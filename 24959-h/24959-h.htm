<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> number of books on the labor problem is
indeed legion. The tragedy of the literature on
any dynamic subject is that most of it is written by
people who have time to do little else. Perhaps the
best books on many subjects will never be written
because those folk, who would be most competent
to do the writing, through their vital connection
with the problem at hand, never find the spare
minutes to put their findings down on paper.</p>

<p>There could be no more dynamic subject than
labor, since labor is nothing less than human beings,
and what is more dynamic than human beings? It
is, therefore, the last subject in the world to be approached
academically. Yet most of the approach
to the problems of labor is academic. Men in sanctuaries
forever far removed from the endless hum and
buzz and roar of machinery, with an intellectual
background and individual ambitions forever far
removed from the interests and desires of those who
labor in factory and mill, theorize&mdash;and another volume
is added to the study of labor.</p>

<p>But, points out some one, there are books on labor
written by bona-fide workers. First, the number is
few. Second, and more important, any bona-fide
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>worker capable of writing any kind of book on any
subject, puts himself so far above the rank and file
that one is justified in asking, for how many does he
speak?</p>

<p>Suppose that for the moment your main intellectual
interest was to ascertain what the average worker&mdash;not
the man or woman so far advanced in the cultural
scale that he or she can set his ideas intelligently
on paper&mdash;thought about his job and things in
general. To what books could you turn? Indeed I
have come to feel that in the pages of O. Henry
there is more to be gleaned on the psychology of the
working class than any books to be found on economic
shelves. The outstanding conclusion forced
upon any reader of such books as consciously attempt
to give a picture of the worker and his job is that
whoever wrote the books was bound and determined
to find out everything that was wrong in every
investigation made, and tell all about the wrongs
and the wrongs only. Goodness knows, if one is
hunting for the things which should be improved in
this world, one life seems all too short to so much as
make a start. In all honesty, then, such books on
labor should be classified under &#8220;Troubles of Workers.&#8221;
No one denies they are legion. Everybody's
troubles are, if troubles are what you want to find.</p>

<p>The Schemer of Things has so arranged, praise be,
that no one's life shall be nothing but woe and misery.
Yea, even workers have been known to smile.</p>


<p class="thought">The experiences lived through in the following
pages may strike the reader as superficial, artificial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
In a way they were. Yet, they fulfilled their object
in my eyes, at least. I wanted to feel for myself
the general &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; of a job, several jobs. I
wanted to know the worker without any suspicion
on the part of the girls and women I labored among
that they were being &#8220;investigated.&#8221; I wanted to
see the world through their eyes&mdash;for the time
being to close my own altogether.</p>

<p>There are no startling new facts or discoveries
here recorded. Nothing in these pages will revolutionize
anything. To such as wish the lot of the
worker painted as the most miserable on earth, they
will be disappointing.</p>

<p>Yet in being as honest as I could in recording the
impressions of my experiences, I am aware that I
have made possible the drawing of false conclusions.
Already such false conclusions have been drawn.
&#8220;See,&#8221; says an &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; employer, &#8220;the
workers are happy&mdash;these articles of Mrs. Parker's
show it. Why should they have better conditions?
They don't want them!&#8221;</p>

<p>A certain type of labor agitator, or a &#8220;parlor
laborite,&#8221; prefer to see only the gloomy side of the
worker's life. They are as dishonest as the employer
who would see only the contentment. The picture
must be viewed in its entirety&mdash;and that means
considering the workers not as a labor problem, but
as a social problem. Workers are not an isolated
group, who keep their industrial adversities or industrial
blessings to themselves. They and their
families and dependents are the majority of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
population. As a nation, we rise no higher in the
long run than the welfare of the majority. Nor can
the word &#8220;welfare,&#8221; if one thinks socially, ever be
limited to the word &#8220;contentment.&#8221; It is quite
conceivable&mdash;nay, every person has seen it in actuality&mdash;that
an individual may be quite contented in
his lot and yet have that lot incompatible with the
welfare of the larger group.</p>

<p>It is but as a part of the larger group that worker,
employer, and the public must come to view the
labor problem. When a worker is found who appears
perfectly amenable to long hours, bad air,
unhygienic conditions in general&mdash;and many are&mdash;somebody
has to pay the price. There are thousands
of contented souls, as we measure contentment, in
the congested tenement districts of East Side New
York. Does that fact add to our social welfare?
Because mothers for years were willing to feed their
children bad milk, was then the movement to provide
good milk for babies a waste of time and money?
Plenty of people always could be found who would
willingly drink impure water. Society found that
too costly, and cities pride themselves to-day on their
pure water supply and low typhoid rate.</p>

<p>There are industrial conditions flourishing which
insidiously take a greater toll of society than did
ever the death of babies from unclean milk, the death
of old and young from impure water. The trouble
is that their effects permeate in ways difficult for the
unwilling eye to see.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the long run, one of the most harmful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
phases of modern civilization is this very contentment
of not only the workers, but the employer and
society at large, under conditions which are not
building up a wholesome, healthy, intelligent population.
Indeed, it is not so much the fault of modern
industrialism as such. Perhaps it is because there
are so many people in the world and the ability of
us human beings, cave men only ten thousand years
ago, to care for so many people has not increased
with the same rapidity as the population. Our numbers
have outrun our capacities. Twentieth century
development calls for large-scale organization for
which the human mind has shown itself inadequate.</p>

<p>It is well to keep in mind that no situation is the
product of its own day. The working woman, for
instance, we have had with us since the beginning
of women&mdash;and they began a good spell ago. The
problem of the working woman, as we think of it
to-day, began with the beginning of modern industry.
Nor is it possible to view her past without realizing
that the tendency has ever been, with but few
interruptions, toward improvement.</p>

<p>In the early factory days in our country it is known
that women rose at four, took their breakfast with
them to the mills, and by five were hard at work in
badly constructed buildings, badly heated, badly
lighted. From seven-thirty to eight-thirty there
was an hour for breakfast, at noon half an hour,
and from then on steady work until half past seven
at night. It would be perhaps eight o'clock before
the mill girls reached home, sometimes too tired to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
stay awake till the end of supper. Later, hours were
more generally from five in the morning until seven
at night. In Lowell the girls worked two hours before
breakfast and went back to the mills again in the
evening after supper. By 1850 twelve hours had come
to be the average working day.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Abbot, <i>Women in Industry</i>.</p></div>

<p>Wages were very low&mdash;around seventy-five cents
or a dollar a week with board. Mills and factories
were accustomed to provide room and board in the
corporation boarding houses, poorly constructed,
ill-ventilated buildings, girls often sleeping six and
eight in a room. In 1836 it was estimated that the
average wage for women in industry (excluding
board) was thirty-seven and one-half cents a day,
although one thousand sewing women investigated
received on an average twenty-five cents a day. In
1835 the New York <i>Journal of Commerce</i> estimated
that at the beginning of the century women's labor
brought about fifty cents a week, which was equivalent
to twenty-five cents in 1835. In 1845 the New
York <i>Tribune</i> reported fifty thousand women averaging
less than two dollars a week wages, and thousands
receiving one dollar and fifty cents. Another
investigation in 1845 found &#8220;female labor in New
York in a deplorable degree of servitude, privation
and misery, drudging on, miserably cooped up in
ill-ventilated cellars and garrets.&#8221; Women worked
fifteen to eighteen hours a day to earn one to three
dollars a week.</p>

<p>And yet authorities tell us that some of the mill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>towns of New England, Lowell in particular, are
looked back upon as being almost idyllic as regards
the opportunities for working women. On examination
it is found that what was exceptional from our
point of view was not the conditions, but the factory
employees. In those days work in the mills was
&#8220;socially permissible.&#8221; Indeed there was practically
no other field of employment open to educated
girls. The old domestic labors had been removed
from the household&mdash;where could a girl with spirit
and ability make the necessary money to carry out
her legitimate desires? Her brothers &#8220;went west&#8221;&mdash;she
went into the factories&mdash;with the same spirit.
Ambitious daughters of New England farmers formed
the bulk of cotton mill employees the first half of the
nineteenth century. Their granddaughters are probably
college graduates of the highest type to-day.
After the long factory hours they found time for
reading, debating clubs, lectures, church activities,
French, and German classes. Part of the time some
of the mill operatives taught school. Many of them
looked forward to furthering their own education in
such female seminaries as existed in those days, the
expense to be met from their mill earnings. Poorly
paid as mill hands were, it was often six to seven
times what teachers received.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mills offered not only regular employment
and higher wages, but educational advantages which
many of the operatives prized even more highly.
Moreover, the girl who had worked in Lowell was
looked upon with respect as a person of importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
when she returned to her rural neighborhood. Her
fashionable dress and manners and her general air of
independence were greatly envied by those who had not
been to the metropolis and enjoyed its advantages.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Abbot, <i>Women in Industry</i>.</p></div>

<p>By 1850 the situation had altered. With the opening
of the west, opportunities for women of gumption
and spirit increased. The industrial depression of
1848-49 lowered wages, and little by little the former
type of operative left the mill, her place being filled
largely by Irish immigrants.</p>

<p>The Civil War saw a great change in the world
of working women. Thousands of men were taken
from industry into war, and overnight great new
fields of opportunity were opened to women. The
more educated were needed as nurses, for teaching
positions, and for various grades of clerical work
deserted by men. After the close of the war farmers
became more prosperous and their daughters were
not forced to work for the wherewithal to acquire
advantages. Add to all this the depression caused
in the cotton industry due to the war&mdash;and the
result of these new conditions was that when the
mills reopened it was with cheap immigrant labor.
What then could have been considered high wages
were offered in an attempt to induce the more efficient
American women operatives back to the
mills, but the cost of living had jumped far higher
even than high wages. The mills held no further
attractions. Even the Irish deserted, their places
being filled with immigrants of a lower type.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>
<p>Since the Civil War look at us&mdash;8,075,772 women
in industry, as against 2,647,157 in 1880. Almost a
fourth of the entire female population over ten years
of age are at work, as against about one-seventh in
1880. The next census figures will show a still larger
proportion. Those thousands of women the World
War threw into industry, who never had worked
before, did not all get out of industry after the war.
Take just the railroads, for example. In April, 1918,
there were 65,816 women employed in railroad work;
in October, 1918, 101,785; and in April, 1919, 86,519.
In the 1910 census, of all the kinds of jobs in our
country filled by men, only twelve were not also
filled by women&mdash;and the next census will show a
reduction there: firemen (either in manufacturing
or railroads), brakemen, conductors, plumbers, common
laborers (under transportation), locomotive
engineers, motormen, policemen, soldiers, sailors,
and marines. The interesting point is that in only
one division of work are women decreasing in proportion
to men&mdash;and that was women's work at the
beginning&mdash;manufacturing. In agriculture, in the
professions, in domestic and personal service, in
trade and transportation, the number of women is
creeping up, up, in proportion to the number of men.
From the point of view of national health and vitality
for this and the next generation, it is indeed a
hopeful sign if women are giving way to men in factories,
mills, and plants, and pushing up into work
requiring more education and in turn not demanding
such physical and nervous strain as does much of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
the machine process. Also, since on the whole as it
has been organized up to date, domestic service has
been one of the least attractive types of work women
could fill, it is encouraging (though not to the housewife)
to find that the proportion of women going into
domestic and personal service has fallen from forty-four
and six-tenths per cent, in 1880, to thirty-two
and five-tenths per cent, in 1910.</p>

<p>Women working at everything under the sun&mdash;except
perhaps being locomotive engineers and
soldiers and sailors. Why?</p>

<p>First, it is part of every normal human being to
want to work. Therefore, women want to work.
Time was when within the home were enough real
life-sized jobs to keep a body on the jump morning
and night. Not only mother but any other females
handy. There are those who grumble that women
could find enough to do at home now if they only
tried. They cannot, unless they have young children
or unless they putter endlessly at nonessentials, the
doing of which leaves them and everybody else no
better off than before they began. And it is part of
the way we are made that besides wanting to work,
we need to work at something we feel &#8220;gets us some
place.&#8221; We prefer to work at something desirable
and useful. Perhaps what we choose is not really so
desirable and useful, looked at in the large, but it
stacks up as more desirable and more useful than
something else we might be doing. And with it all,
if there is to be any real satisfaction, must go some
feeling of independence&mdash;of being on &#8220;one's own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>So, then, women go out to work in 1921 because
there is not enough to do to keep them busy at
home. They follow in part their age-old callings,
only nowadays performed in roaring factories instead
of by the home fireside. In part they take to new
callings. Whatever the job may be, women <i>want</i> to
work in preference to the nonproductiveness of most
home life to-day.</p>

<p>Graham Wallas, in his <i>Great Society</i>, quotes the
answers given by a number of girls to a woman who
held their confidence as to why they worked. He
wished to learn if they were happy. The question
meant to the girls evidently, &#8220;Are you happier than
you would have been at home?&#8221; and practically
every answer was &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a &#8220;dismal and murky,&#8221; but fairly well-managed
laundry, six Irish girls all answered they were happy.
One said the work &#8220;took up her mind, she had been
awfully discontented.&#8221; Another that &#8220;you were of
some use.&#8221; Another, &#8220;the hours went so much
faster. At home one could read, but only for a short
time. Then there was the awful lonesome afternoon
ahead of you.&#8221; &#8220;Asked a little girl with dyed hair
but a good little heart. She enjoyed her work. It
made her feel she was worth something.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another laundry, the first six girls all answered
they were happy because the &#8220;work takes up your
mind,&#8221; and generally added, &#8220;It's awful lonesome at
home,&#8221; or &#8220;there is an awful emptiness at home.&#8221;
However, one girl with nine brothers and sisters
was happy in the collar packing room just because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
&#8220;it was so awful lonesome&#8221;&mdash;she could enjoy her
own thoughts. An Irishwoman at another laundry
who had married an Italian said, &#8220;Sure I am always
happy. It leaves me no time to think.&#8221; At a knitting
plant one girl said &#8220;when she didn't work, she
was always thinking of dead people, but work always
made her cheer up directly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great industrial population comes from
crowded tenements. It is inconceivable that enough
work could be found within those walls to make life
attractive to the girls and young women growing to
maturity in such households.</p>

<p>So much for the psychological side. The fact remains
that the great bulk of women in industry work
because they <i>have</i> to work&mdash;they enter industrial
life to make absolutely necessary money. The old
tasks at which a woman could be self-supporting in
the home are no longer possible in the home. She
earns her bread now as she has earned it for thousands
of years&mdash;spinning, weaving, sewing, baking,
cooking&mdash;only to-day she is one of hundreds, thousands
in a great factory. Nor is she longer confined
to her traditional tasks. Men are playing a larger
part in what was since time began and up to a few
years ago woman's work. Women, in their need, are
finding employment at any work that can use unskilled
less physically capable labor.</p>

<p>Ever has it been the very small proportion of men
who could by their unaided effort support the entire
family. At no time have all the men in a country
been able to support all the women, regardless of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
whether that situation would be desirable. Always
must the aid of womenfolk be called in as a matter
of course. We have a national ideal of a living wage
to the male head of the family which will allow him
to support his family without forcing his wife and
children into industry. Any man who earns less than
that amount during the year must depend on the
earnings of wife and children or else fall below the
minimum necessary to subsistence, with all which
that implies. In 1910, four-fifths of the heads of
families in the United States earned under eight hundred
dollars a year. At that same time, almost nine-tenths
of the women workers living at home in New
York City working in factories, mills, and such
establishments, paid their entire earnings to the
family. Of 13,686 women investigated in Wisconsin
in 1914, only 2 per cent gave nothing to the family
support. Of girls in retail stores living at home in
New York City, 84 per cent paid their entire earnings
to the family. Work, then, for the majority of
women, is more apt to be cold economic necessity&mdash;not
only for herself, but for her family.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that great numbers of women
must work and many want to work, there are the
reasons for women's work arising in modern industry
itself. First, a hundred years ago, there was the
need for hands in the new manufactures, and because
of the even more pressing agricultural demands,
men could not be spared. The greater the subdivisions
of labor up to a certain point, the simpler the
process, and the more women can be used, unskilled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
as they are ever apt to be. Also they will work at
more monotonous, more disagreeable work than
men, and for less wages. Again, women's entrance
into new industries has often been as strike breakers,
and once in, there was no way to get them out.
Industrial depressions throw men out of work, and
also women, and in the financial pressure following,
women turn to any sort of work at any sort of pay,
and perhaps open a new wedge for women's work in
a heretofore untried field, desirable or undesirable.</p>

<p>The freedom from having to perform every and
all domestic functions within the four walls of home
is purchased at the expense of millions of toilers outside
the home, the majority of whom do not to-day
receive enough wages, where they are the menfolk,
to support their own families; nor where they are
single women, to support themselves. The fact that
men cannot support their families forces women in
large numbers into industry. There would be nothing
harmful in that, if only industry were organized so
that participation in it enriched human lives. Remembering
always that where industry takes women
from the care of young children, society and the
nation pay dearly; for, inadequate and ignorant as
mothers often are regarding child care, their substitutes
to-day are apt to be even less efficient.</p>

<p>Pessimists marshal statistics to show that modern
industrialism is going to rack and ruin. Maybe it is.
But pessimism is more a matter of temperament than
statistics. An optimist can assemble a most cheerful
array of figures to show that everything is on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
up. Temperament again. Industry is what industry
does. If you are feeling gloomy to-day, you can visit
factories where it is plain to see that no human
being could have his lot improved by working there.
Such factories certainly exist. If you would hug
your pessimism to your soul, then there are many
factories you must stay away from. Despite all the
pessimists, there is a growing tendency to increase
the welfare of human beings in industry.</p>

<p>It is but an infinitesimal drop any one individual
can contribute to hasten a saner industrialism. Yet
some of us would so fain contribute our mite! Where
the greatest need of all lies is that the human beings
in industry, the employer and the employees, shall
better understand one another, and society at large
better understand both. My own amateur and
humble experiences here recorded have added much
to my own understanding of the problems of both
manager and worker.</p>

<p>Can they add even a fraction to the understanding
of anyone else?</p>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ise</span> heads tell us we act first&mdash;or decide to act
first&mdash;and reason afterward. Therefore, what
could be put down in black and white as to why we
took up factory work is of minor value or concern.
Yet everyone persists in asking why? So then, being
merely as honest as the Lord allows, we answer first
and foremost because we wanted to. Isn't that
enough? It is the why and wherefore of almost
everything anyone does any place at any time.
Only the more adept can concoct much weightier
reasons as an afterthought. There is only one life
most of us doubting humans are absolutely sure of.
That one life gets filled with so much of the same
sort of performance day in and day out; usually
only an unforeseen calamity&mdash;or stroke of luck&mdash;throws
us into a way of living and doing things
which is not forever just as we lived and did things
yesterday and the day before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the world is so full of the unexplored! To
those who care more for people than places, around
every corner is something new&mdash;a world only dreamt
of, if that. Why should all one's life be taken up
with the kind of people we were born among, doing
the sort of things our aunts and our uncles and our
cousins and our friends do? Soon there creeps in&mdash;soon?
yes, by six years or younger&mdash;that comforting
belief that as we and our aunts and our uncles and
our cousins and our friends do, so does&mdash;or should
do&mdash;the world. And all the time we and our aunts
and our uncles and our cousins and our friends are
one little infinitesimal drop in one hundred million
people, and what those above and below and beyond
and around about think and do, we know nothing,
nor care nothing, about. But those others are the
world, with us, a speck of&mdash;well, in this case it happened
to be curiosity&mdash;in the midst of it all.</p>

<p>Therefore, being curious, we decided to work in
factories. In addition to wanting to feel a bona-fide
part of a cross section of the world before only
viewed second or third hand through books, there was
the desire better to understand the industrial end
of things by trying a turn at what some eight million
or so other women are doing. &#8220;Women's place is the
home.&#8221; All right&mdash;that side of life we know first
hand. But more and more women are not staying
home, either from choice or from necessity. Reading
about it is better than nothing. Being an active
part of it all is better still. It is one thing to lounge
on an overstuffed davenport and read about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
injurious effect on women of long hours of standing.
It is another to be doing the standing.</p>

<p>Yet another reason for giving up some months to
factory work, besides the adventure of it, besides the
desire to see other angles of life for oneself, to experience
first hand the industrial end of it. So much
of the technic of the world to-day we take as a matter
of course. Clothes appear ready to put on our backs.
As far as we know or care, angels left them on the
hangers behind the mirrored sliding doors. Food is
set on our tables ready to eat. It might as well have
been created that way, for all our concern. The
thousands of operations that go into an article before
the consumer buys it&mdash;no, there is no reason why
use and want should make us callous and indifferent
to the hows and wherefores. Never was there such
an age. Let's poke behind the scenes a bit.</p>

<p>So, factories it was to be. Not as a stranger
snooping in to &#8220;investigate.&#8221; As a factory girl
working at her job&mdash;with all that, we determined to
peek out of the corner of our eyes, and keep both
ears to the wind, lest we miss anything from start to
finish. Artificial, of course. Under the circumstances,
since we were born how and as we were, and
this had happened and that, we were not an honest
Eyetalian living in a back bedroom on West Forty-fourth
Street near the river.</p>

<p>We did what we could to feel the part. Every
lady in the land knows the psychology of dress&mdash;though
not always expressed by her in those terms.
She feels the way she looks, not the other way round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
So then, we purchased large green earrings, a large
bar pin of platinum and brilliants ($1.79), a goldy box
of powder (two shades), a lip stick. During the
summer we faded a green tam-o'shanter so that it
would not look too new. For a year we had been
saving a blue-serge dress (original cost $19) from the
rag bag for the purpose. We wore a pair of old spats
which just missed being mates as to shade, and a
button off one. Silk stockings&mdash;oh yes, silk&mdash;but
very darned. A blue sweater, an orange scarf, and
last, but not least&mdash;</p>

<p>If you had been brought up in a fairly small city
by female relatives who were one and all school-teachers,
who had watched over your vocabulary
(unsuccessfully) as they hung over your morals;
if you had been taught, not in so many words, but
insidiously, that breaking the Ten Commandments
(any one or the entire ten), split infinitives, and chewing
gum, were one in the sight of God, or the devil&mdash;then
you could realize the complete metamorphosis
when, in addition to the earrings and the bar pin,
the green tam and the lip stick, you stepped up to
the Subway newsstand and boldly demanded a
package of&mdash;chewing gum. And then and there got
out a stick and chewed it, and chewed it on the
Subway and chewed it on the streets of New York.
Some people have to go to a masquerade ball to feel
themselves some one else for a change. Others, if
they have been brought up by school-teachers, can
get the same effect with five cents' worth of chewing
gum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, one of the most attractive features about
being &#8220;well brought up&#8221; is the fun of sloughing off.
The fun of sloughing off a lot at once! Had it ever
been known ahead of time the fascination of doing
forbidden things, just that first factory morning
would have been worth the whole venture. To read
the morning paper over other people's shoulders&mdash;not
furtively, but with a bold and open eye. To stare
at anything which caught one's attention. (Bah! all
that is missed in New York because it has been so
ground into the bone that it is impolite to stare!)
And to talk to any one, male or female, who looked or
acted as if he or she wanted to talk to you. Only
even a short experience has taught that that abandon
leads to more trouble than it is worth. What a pity
mere sociability need suffer so much repression! We
hate to make that concession to our upbringers.</p>

<p>When the time for beginning factory work came
there appeared but one advertisement among &#8220;Help
Wanted&mdash;Female&#8221; which did not call for &#8220;experience.&#8221;
There might have to be so much lying, direct
and indirect, to do. Better not start off by claiming
experience when there was absolutely none&mdash;except,
indeed, had we answered advertisements for cooks
only, or baby tenders, or maids of all work. One
large candy factory bid for &#8220;girls and women, good
wages to start, experience not necessary,&#8221; and in a
part of town which could be reached without starting
out the night before. At 7.15 of a Monday morning
we were off, with a feeling something akin to stage
fright. Once we heard a hobo tell of the first time he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ever tried to get on a freight train in the dark of
night when it was moving. But we chewed our gum
very boldly.</p>

<p>One of the phases of finding a job often criticized
by those who would add somewhat of dignity to
labor is the system of hiring. Like a lot of other
things, perhaps, you don't mind the present system
if you get by. Here was this enormous good-looking
factory. On one side of the front steps, reaching all
the way up into the main entrance hall, stood a line
of men waiting for jobs; on the other side, though
not near so long a line, the girls. The regular employees
file by. At last, about eight o'clock, the first
man is beckoned. Just behind the corner of a glassed-in
telephone booth, but in full view of all, he is questioned
by an employee in a white duck suit. Man
after man is sent on out, to the growing discouragement,
no doubt, of those remaining in line. At last,
around a little corner in the stairs, the first girl is
summoned. The line moves up. A queer-looking
man with pop eyes asks a few questions. The girl
goes on upstairs. I am fourth in line&mdash;a steam heater
next and the actions of my insides make the temperature
seem 120 at least. My turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much experience you've had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you work in last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn't work in a factory&mdash;been doin' housework&mdash;takin'
care of kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I start you packing. You get thirteen dollars
this week, fourteen dollars next&mdash;you understand?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He writes something on a little card and I go upstairs
with it. There I am asked my name, age (just
did away with ten years while I was at it). Married
or single? Goodness! hadn't thought of that. In
the end a lie there would make less conversation.
Single. Nationality&mdash;Eyetalian? No, American.
It all has to be written on a card. At that point my
eye lights on a sign which reads: &#8220;Hours for girls
8 <small>A.M.</small>-6 <small>P.M.</small> Saturdays 8-12.&#8221; Whew! My
number is 1075. The time clock works so. My key
hangs on this hook; then after I ring up, it hangs
here. (That was an entrancing detail I had not anticipated&mdash;made
me wish we had to ring up at noon
as well as morning and night.) Locker key 222. A
man takes me in the elevator to the third floor and
there hands me over to Ida. The locker works thus
and so. Didn't I have no apron? No&mdash;but to-morrow
I'd bring it, and a cap. Sure.</p>

<p>Three piles of boxes and trucks and barrels and
Ida opens a great door like a safe, and there we are
in the packing room&mdash;from the steam heater downstairs
to the North Pole. Cold? Nothing ever was
so cold. Ten long zinc-topped tables, a girl or two
on each side. At the right, windows which let in no
air and little light, nor could you see out at all. On
the left, shelves piled high with wooden boxes.
Mostly all a body can think of is how cold, cold, cold
it is. Something happens to chocolates otherwise.</p>

<p>That first day it is half-pound boxes. My side of
the table holds some sixty at a time. First the date
gets stamped on the bottom, then partitions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fitted in. &#8220;Here's your sample. Under the table
you'll find the candies, or else ask Fannie, there.
You take the paper cups so, in your left hand, give
them a snap so, lick your fingers now and then, slip
a cup off, stick the candy in with your right hand.&#8221;
And Ida is off.</p>

<p>The saints curse the next person who delicately
picks a chocolate from its curled casing and thinks
it grew that way&mdash;came born in that paper cup.
May he or she choke on it! Can I ever again buy
chocolates otherwise than loose in a paper bag?
You push and shove&mdash;not a cup budges from its
friends and relatives. Perhaps your fingers need
more licking. Perhaps the cups need more &#8220;snapping.&#8221;
In the end you hold a handful of messed-up
crumpled erstwhile cup-shaped paper containers, the
first one pried off looking more like a puppy-chewed
mat by the time it is loose and a chocolate planted
on its middle. By then, needless to remark, the
bloom is off the chocolate. It has the look of being
clutched in a warm hand during an entire circus
parade. Whereat you glance about furtively and
quickly eat it. It is nice the room is cold; already
you fairly perspire. One mussed piece of naked
brown paper in a corner of a box.</p>

<p>The table ahead, fingers flying like mad over the
boxes, works Annie. It is plain she will have sixty
boxes done before I have one. Just then a new girl
from the line of that morning is put on the other
side of my table. She is very cold. She fares worse
with brown paper cups than I. Finally she puts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
down the patient piece of chocolate candy and takes
both hands to the job of separating one cup from the
others. She places what is left of the chocolate in the
middle of what is left of the paper, looks at me, and
better than any ouija board I know what is going on in
her head. I smile at her, she smiles back, and she eats
that first chocolate. Tessie and I are friends for life.</p>

<p>Then we tackle the second union of chocolate and
paper. Such is life. Allah be praised, the second
goes a shade less desperately than the first, the
third than the second, and in an hour chocolate and
paper get together without untoward damage to
either. But the room stays feeling warm. Anon a
sensation begins to get mixed up with the hectic
efforts of fingers. Yes, yes&mdash;now it's clear what it is&mdash;feet!
Is one never to sit down again as long as
one lives? Clumsy fingers&mdash;feet. Feet&mdash;clumsy
fingers. Finally you don't give a cent if you never
learn to pry those paper cups loose without wrenching
your very soul in the effort. If once before you die&mdash;just
once&mdash;you can sit down! Till 12 and then after,
1 till 6. Help!</p>

<p>A bell rings. &#8220;All right, girls!&#8221; sings Ida down the
line. Everyone drops everything, and out into the
warm main third floor we go. All the world is feet.
Somehow those same feet have to take their possessor
out to forage for food. Into a little dirty,
crowded grocery and delicatessen store we wedge
ourselves, to stand, stand, stand, until at last we
face the wielder of a long knife. When in Rome do
as the Romans do. &#8220;A bologna and a ham sandwich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and five cents' worth of pickles.&#8221; Slabs of rye bread,
no butter, large, generous slices of sausage and ham
which hang down curtainlike around the bread&mdash;twenty-one
cents. Feet take me back to the factory
lunch room. At last I flop on a chair. Sing songs
to chairs; write poems to chairs; paint chairs!</p>

<p>Dear German Tessie, pal of the morning, she who
ate more chocolates than I and thus helped to sustain
my moral courage&mdash;Tessie and I eat bologna sausage
sandwiches together and <i>sit</i>. The feet of Tessie
are very, very badly off&mdash;ach!&mdash;but they feel&mdash;they
feel&mdash;jus' fierce&mdash;and till six o'clock&mdash;&#8220;Oh, my
Gawd!&#8221; says Tessie, in good English.</p>

<p>A gong sounds. Up we go to the ice box packing
room. It sends the shivers down our spines. But
already there is a feeling of sauntering in like an old
hand at the game. What's your business in life?
Packing chocolates. The half-pound boxes get
finished, wax paper on top, covered, stacked, counted,
put on the truck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lena! Start the girl here in on 'assorteds.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Pert little Lena sidles up alongside and nudges
me in the ribs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, got a fella?&#8221;</p>

<p>I give Lena one look, for which Belasco should
pay me a thousand dollars a night. Lena reads it
out loud quick as a wink. She snickers, pokes me
in the ribs again, and, &#8220;What to hell do I think you
are, hey?&#8221; That's just what I'd meant. &#8220;Gee!&#8221;
says Lena. &#8220;Some fool what can't get some kind of
a dope!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, got more 'n one dope?&#8221; asks Lena, hopefully.
Meanwhile she sets out, with my aid, row
after row of dinky little deep boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say now,&#8221; say I to Lena, &#8220;and what would a
girl be doin' with jus' <i>one</i> dope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; says Lena.</p>

<p>At which follows a discussion on dopes, ending
by Lena's promising never to vamp my dope if I
won't vamp hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where'd ya work last?&#8221; asks Lena.</p>

<p>One thing the first day taught me. If you want to
act the part and feel the part, earrings and gum help,
but if there is one thing you are more conscious of
than all else, it is such proper English as you possess&mdash;which
compared to Boston is not much, but compared
to Lena and Ida and Mary and Louise and
Susie and Annie is painfully flawless. Chew hard as
ever you can, if you tell Fannie, &#8220;There aren't any
more plantations,&#8221; it echoes and re-echoes and shrieks
at you from the four sides of Christendom. But
holler, &#8220;Fannie, there ain't no more plantations!&#8221;
and it is like the gentle purring of a home cat by
comparison. Funny how it is easier to say &#8220;My
Gawd!&#8221; and &#8220;Where t' hell's Ida!&#8221; than &#8220;I 'ain't
got none.&#8221; Any way round, you never do get over
being conscious of your grammar. If it is correct, it
is lonesome as the first robin. If it is properly awful,
there are those school-teacher upbringers. I am just
wondering if one might not be dining with the head
of the university philosophy department and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
academic guests some night and hear one's voice
uttering down a suddenly silent table, &#8220;She ain't
livin' at that address no more.&#8221; Utterly abashed,
one's then natural exclamation on the stillness would
be, &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; Whereat the hostess would busily
engage her end of the table in anguished conversation,
giving her husband one look, which, translated
into Lena's language, would say, &#8220;What t' hell did
we ask her for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Is one to write of factory life as one finds it, or
expurgated? I can hear the upbringers cry &#8220;expurgated&#8221;!
Yet the way the girls talked was one of
the phases of the life which set the stamp of difference
on it all. What an infinitesimal portion of the
population write our books! What a small proportion
ever read them! How much of the nation's
talking is done by the people who never get into
print! The proportion who read and write books,
especially the female folk, live and die in the belief
that it is the worst sort of bad taste, putting it mildly,
to use the name of the Creator in vain, or mention
hell for any purpose whatsoever. Yet suddenly,
overnight, you find yourself in a group who would
snap their fingers at such notions. Sweet-faced,
curly-headed Annie wants another box of caramels.
Elizabeth Witherspoon would call, &#8220;Fannie, would
you be so kind as to bring me another box of caramels?&#8221;
Annie, without stopping her work or so
much as looking up, raises her voice and calls down
the room&mdash;and in her heart she is the same exactly
as Elizabeth W.&mdash;&#8220;Fannie, you bum, bring me a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
box of car'mels or I'll knock the hell clean out o'
ya.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Elizabeth's notions Fannie should
answer her, &#8220;One moment, Miss Elizabeth; I'm
busy just now.&#8221; What Fannie (with her soul as
pure as drifted snow) does call back to Annie is,
&#8220;My Gawd! Keep your mouth shut. 'Ain't you
got sense enough to see I'm busy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Annie could holler a hundred times, and she does,
that she'd knock the hell out of Fannie, and God
would love her every bit as much as he would love
Miss Elizabeth Witherspoon, who has been taught
otherwise and never said hell in her life, not even in
a dark closet. Fannie and all the other Fannies and
Idas and Louisas, say, &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; as Miss Elizabeth
says &#8220;You don't say!&#8221; and it is all one to the
Heavenly Father. Therefore, gentle reader, it must
be all one to you. There is not the slightest shade of
disrespect in Annie's or Fannie's hearts as they
shower their profanity on creation in general. There
is not the slightest shade in mind as I write of them.</p>

<p>So then, back that first day Lena asked, &#8220;Where'd
ya work last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn't work in a factory before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Ain't ya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I 'ain't.&#8221; (Gulp.) &#8220;I took care of kids.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! but they was fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lena!&#8221; hollers Ida. &#8220;Get ta work and don't
talk so much!&#8221; Whereat Lena gives me another
poke in my cold ribs and departs. And Tessie and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pack &#8220;assorteds&#8221;: four different chocolates in the
bottom of each box, four still different ones in the
top&mdash;about three hundred and fifty boxes on our
table. We puff and labor on the top layer and Ida
breezes along. &#8220;My Gawd! Look at that! Where's
your cardboards?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tessie and I look woebegone at one another.
Cardboards? Cardboards?</p>

<p>Ida glues her Eyetalian eye on Lena down the line.
&#8220;Lena, you fool, didn't you tell these here girls about
cardboards?... My Gawd! My Gawd!&#8221; says Ida.
Whereat she dives into our belabored boxes and grabs
those ached-over chocolates and hurls them in a pile.
&#8220;Get all them top ones out. Put in cardboards.
Put 'em all in again.&#8221; Tessie and I almost could
have wept. By that time it is about 4. We are all
feet, feet, <small>FEET</small>. First I try standing on one foot to
let the other think I might really, after all, be sitting
down. Then I stand on it and give the other a delusion.
Then try standing on the sides, the toes, the
heels. <span class="smcap">Feet!</span> &#8220;Ach! Mein Gott!&#8221; moans Tessie.
&#8220;To-morrow I go look for a job in a biscuit factory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me know if you get a sit-down one.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in that state&mdash;<small>FEET</small>&mdash;Ida makes us pack over
the whole top layer in three hundred and fifty boxes.
Curses on Lena and her &#8220;dopes.&#8221; Or curses on me
that I could so suddenly invent such picturesque love
affairs that Lena forgot all about cardboards.</p>

<p>About then my locker key falls through a hole in
my waist pocket and on to the floor and out of sight.
In the end it takes a broom handle poked about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
diligently under the bottom shelf of our table to
make a recovery. Before the key appear chocolates
of many shapes and sizes, long reposing in oblivion
under the weighty table. The thrifty Spanish woman
behind me gathers up all the unsquashed ones and
packs them. &#8220;Mus' be lots of chocolates under
these 'ere tables, eh?&#8221; she notes wisely and with
knit brows. As if to say that, were she boss, she'd
poke with a broom under each and every bottom
shelf and fill many a box.</p>

<p>At least my feet get a moment's rest while I am
down on my hands and knees among the debris from
under the tables.</p>

<p>By five o'clock Tessie thinks she'll throw up her
job then and there. &#8220;Ach! Ach! My feet!&#8221; she
moans. I secretly plan to kill the next person who
gives me a box of chocolate candy.</p>

<p>Surely it is almost 6.</p>

<p>Five minutes after 5.</p>

<p>The bell has forgotten to ring. It must be 7.</p>

<p>Quarter after 5.</p>

<p>Now for sure and certain it is midnight.</p>

<p>Half-past 5.</p>

<p>My earrings begin to hurt. You can take off earrings.
But <small>FEET</small>&mdash;</p>

<p>Tessie says she's eaten too many candies; her
stomach does her pain. Her feet aren't so hurting
now her <i>magen</i> is so bad. I couldn't eat another
chocolate for five dollars, but my stomach refused to
feel in any way that takes my mind in the least off
my feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Eternity has passed on. It must be beyond the
Judgment Day itself.</p>

<p>Ten minutes to 6.</p>

<p>When the bell does ring I am beyond feeling any
emotion. There is no part of me with which to feel
emotion. I am all feet, and feet either do not feel
at all or feel all weary unto death. During the summer
I had played one match in a tennis tournament
7-5, 5-7, 13-11. I had thought I was ready to drop
dead after that. It was mere knitting in the parlor
compared to how I felt after standing at that table
in that candy factory from 8 <small>A.M.</small> to 6 <small>P.M.</small>, with a
bit of a half-hour's sitting at noon.</p>

<p>Somehow you could manage to endure it all if it
were not for the crowning agony of all&mdash;standing up
on the Subway going home. I am no aggressive
feminist, and I am no old-fashioned clinging vine,
but I surely do hate, hate, hate every man in that
Subway who sits back in comfort (and most of them
look as if they had been sitting all day) while I and
my feet stand up. When in my utter anguish I find
myself swaying with the jerks and twists of the express
in front of a person with a Vandyke beard reading
<i>The Gospel According to St. John</i>, I long with all
the energy left in me (I still have some in my arms)
to grab that book out of his hands, fling it in his face,
and hiss, &#8220;Hypocrite!&#8221; at him. I do not believe I
ever knew what it was really and honestly to hate a
person before. If it had been the <i>Police Gazette</i> I
could have borne up under it. But <i>The Gospel According
to St. John</i>&mdash;my Gawd!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus ends my first factory day. It is small comfort
to calculate I stepped on more chocolates in
those nine hours than I usually eat in a year. To
be sure, it was something new on the line of life's
experiences. If that man in front of me were only a
chocolate with soft insides and I could squash him
flat! Yes, there was enough energy in my feet for
that. To get my heel square above him and then
<i>stamp</i>&mdash;ugh! the sinner! He continues reading <i>The
Gospel According to St. John</i>, nor so much as looks
up to receive my last departing glare as I drag myself
off at 116th Street.</p>

<p>Bless the Lord, O my soul, the next morning my
feet feel as if they had never been stood on before.
What if we do have to stand up in the Subway all
the way down? Who minds standing in the Subway?
And then stand in the jammed and elbowing cross-town
car. Who cares? And how we do walk up
those factory steps as if we owned the world! The
chestiness of us as we take our key off left-hand hook
1075, ring up under the clock (twenty minutes early
we are) and hang up on No. 1075 right; but it seems
you are late if you are not ten minutes early. It is
the little tricks like that you get wise about.</p>

<p>I saunter over to the elevator with a jam of colored
girls&mdash;the majority of the girls in that factory were
colored. I call out, &#8220;Third, please.&#8221; Oh, glory be!
Why were we ever born? That elevator man turns
around and pierces me with his eye as though I were
the man with the Vandyke beard in the Subway, and
he, the elevator man, were I. &#8220;<i>Third</i> floor did ya<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
say? And since when does the elevator lift ya to
the <i>third</i> floor? If ya want the sixth floor ya can
ride. <i>Third</i> floor! My Gawd! <i>Third</i> floor!&#8221; And
on and on he mutters and up and up I go, all the
proud feelings of owning the world stripped from me&mdash;exposed
before the multitudes as an ignoramus
who didn't know any better than to ride in the elevator
when she was bound only for the third floor.
&#8220;<i>Third</i> floor,&#8221; continues muttering the elevator man.
At last there is no one left in the elevator but the
muttering man and me. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I falter, chewing
weakly on my Black Jack, &#8220;What shall I do, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll leave ya off at the third this time, but don't
ya try this trick again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again? Goodness! You don't think I'd make
this mistake twice, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Twice?</i>&#8221; he bellows. &#8220;<i>Twice?</i> Didn't I have
this all out with ya yesterday mornin'?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness, no!&#8221; I try to assure him, but he is
putting me off at third and calling after me: &#8220;Don't
I know I did tell ya all this yesterday mornin'?
And don't ya forget it next time, neither.&#8221; It must
be awful to be that man's wife. But I love him compared
to the Vandyke beard in the Subway reading
<i>The Gospel According to St. John</i>.</p>

<p>Everybody is squatting about on scant corners
and ledges waiting for the eight o'clock bell. I squat
next the thrifty Spanish lady, whereat she immediately
begins telling me the story of her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You married?&#8221; she asks. No. &#8220;Well don' you
do it,&#8221; says the fat and mussy Espaniole, as the girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
called her. &#8220;I marry man&mdash;five years, all right.
One morning I say, 'I go to church&mdash;you go too?'
He say 'No, I stay home.' I go church. I come
home. I fin' him got young girl there. I say, 'You
clear out my house, you your young girl!' Out he
go, she go. 'Bout one year 'go he say he come back.
I say no you don'. He beg me, beg me come home.
I say no, no, no. He write me letter, letter, letter.
I say no, no, no. Bymby I say alright, you come
live my house don't you <i>touch</i> me, hear? Don' you
<i>touch</i> me. He live one room, I live one room. He
no touch me. Two weeks 'go he die. Take all my
money, put him in cemetery. I have buy me black
waist, black skirt. I got no money more. I want
move from that house&mdash;no want live that house no
more&mdash;give me bad dreams. I got no money move.
Got son thirteen. He t'ink me fool have man around
like that. I no care. See he sen's letter, letter,
letter. Now I got no money. I have work.&#8221; The
bell rings. We shiver ourselves into the ice box.</p>

<p>No Tessie across the table. Instead a strange,
unkempt female who sticks it out half an hour, announces
she has the chills in her feet, and departs.
Her place is taken by a slightly less disheveled young
woman who claims she'd packed candy before where
they had seats and she thought she'd go back.
They paid two dollars less a week, but it was worth
two dollars to sit down. How she packs! The sloppiest
work I ever saw. It outrages my soul. The
thrill of new pride I have when Ida gets through
swearing at her and turns to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your eye on this girl, will ya? Gee! she
packs like a fright!&#8221; And to the newcomer: &#8220;You
watch that girl across the table&#8221; (me, she means&mdash;me!)
&#8220;and do the way she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>No first section I ever got in economics gave me
such joy.</p>

<p>But, ah! the first feeling of industrial bitterness
creeps in. Here is a girl getting fourteen dollars a
week. Tessie was promised fourteen dollars a week.
I packed faster, better, than either of them for thirteen
dollars. I would have fourteen dollars, too, or
know the reason why. Ida fussed and scolded over
the new girls all day. The sweetness of her entire
neglect of me!</p>

<p>By that noon my feet hardly hurt at all. I sit in
a quiet corner to eat rye-bread sandwiches brought
from home, gambling on whom I will draw for luncheon
company. Six colored girls sit down at my
table. A good part of the time they spend growling
on the subject of overtime. I am too new to know
what it is all about.</p>

<p>The lunch room is a bare, whitewashed, huge affair,
with uplifting advice on the walls here and there.
&#8220;Any fool can take a chance; it takes brains to be
careful,&#8221; and such like. One got me all upset:
&#8220;America is courteous to its women. Gentlemen
will, therefore, please remove their hats in this room.&#8221;
That Vandyke beard in the Subway!</p>

<p>By 4.30 again I think my feet will be the death of
me. That last hour and a half! Louie, the general
errand boy of our packing room, brushes by our table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with some trays and knocks about six of my carefully
packed boxes on the floor. &#8220;You Louie!&#8221; I holler, and
I long to have acquired the facility to call lightly
after him, as anyone else would have done, &#8220;Say,
you go to hell!&#8221; Instead, mustering all the reserve
force I can, the best showing I am able to make is,
&#8220;You Louie! Go off and die!&#8221; I almost hold my
own&mdash;468 boxes of &#8220;assorteds&#8221; do I pack. And
again the anguishing stand in the Subway. I hate
men&mdash;hate them. I just hope every one of them gets
greeted by a nagging wife when he arrives home.
Hope she nags all evening.... If enough of those
wives really did do enough nagging, would the men
thereupon stay downtown for dinner and make room
in the Subway for folk who had been standing, except
for one hour, from 7.15 <small>A.M.</small>? At last I see a silver
lining to the dark cloud of marital unfelicity....</p>


<p class="thought">Lillian of the bright-pink boudoir cap engaged me
in conversation this morning. Lillian is around the
Indian summer of life&mdash;as to years, but not atmosphere.
Lillian has seen better days. Makes sure you
know it. Never did a lick of work in her life. At
that she makes a noise with her upper lip the way a
body does in southern Oregon when he uses a toothpick
after a large meal. &#8220;No, sir, never did a lick.&#8221;
Lillian says &#8220;did&#8221; and not &#8220;done.&#8221; Practically no
encouragement is needed for Lillian to continue.
&#8220;After my husband died I blew in all the money he
left me in two years. Since then I have been packing
chocolates.&#8221; How long ago was that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Five years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd,&#8221; I say, and it comes natural-like.
&#8220;What did you do with your feet for five years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you get used to it,&#8221; says Lillian. &#8220;For
months I cried every night. Don't any more. But I
lie down while I'm warmin' up my supper, and then
I go to bed soon as its et.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five years!</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin' to vote?&#8221; asks Lillian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm not,&#8221; allows Lillian. &#8220;To my notions all
that votin' business is nothing for a lady to get mixed
up in. No, sir.&#8221; Lillian makes that noise with her
upper lip again. Lillian's lips are very red, her eyebrows
very black. I'll not do anything, though, with
my eyebrows. Says Lillian: &#8220;No, siree, not for a
lady. I got a good bet up on the election. Yes, sir!&mdash;fifty
dollars on Harding.&#8221;</p>

<p>And five years of going to bed every night after
supper.</p>

<p>Tessie is back. I do love Tessie, and I know Tessie
loves me. She had not gone hunting for another job,
as I thought. Her husband had had his elbow broken
with an electric machine of some sort where he works
on milk cans. The morning before she had taken
him to the hospital. That made her ten minutes late
to the factory. The little pop-eyed man told her,
&#8220;You go on home!&#8221; and off she went. &#8220;But he tell
me that once more I no come back again,&#8221; said Tessie,
her cheeks very red.</p>

<p>I begin to get the &#8220;class feeling&#8221;&mdash;to understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a lot of things I wanted to know first hand. In the
first place, there is no thought ever, and I don't see
in that factory how there can be, for the boss and his
interests. Who is he? Where is he? The nearest
one comes to him is the pop-eyed man at the door.
Once in a while Ida hollers &#8220;For Gawd's sake, girls,
work faster!&#8221; Now that doesn't inspire to increased
production for long. There stands Tessie across the
table from me&mdash;peasant Tessie from near M&uuml;nchen,
with her sweet face and white turned-up cap. She
packs as fast as she can, but her hands are clumsy
and she can't seem to get the difference between
chocolates very well. It is enough to drive a seer
crazy. They change the positions on the shelves
every so often; the dipping-machine tenders cut
capers and mark the same kind of chocolates differently
to-day from yesterday. By three in the afternoon
you're too sick of chocolates to do any more investigating
by sampling. Even Ida herself has sometimes
to poke a candy in the bottom&mdash;if it feels one
way it's &#8220;marsh&#8221;; another, it's peach; another, it's
coconut. But my feeling is not educated and I poke,
and then end by having to bite, and then, just as I
discover it is peach, after all, some one has run off
with the last box and Ida has to be found and a substitute
declared.</p>

<p>Tessie gives up in despair and hurls herself on me.
So then Tessie is nearest to me in the whole factory,
and Tessie is slow. The faster I pack the more it
shows up Tessie's slowness. If Ida scolded Tessie
it would break my heart. The thought of the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
who owns that factory, and his orders and his profits
and his obligations, never enter my or any other
packer's head. I will not pack so many boxes that
Tessie gets left too far behind.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing happens. All of a sudden I
get more interested in packing chocolates than anything
else on earth. A little knack or twist comes to
me&mdash;my fingers fly (for me). I forget Tessie. I
forget the time. I forget my feet. How many boxes
can I pack to-day? That is all I can think of. I
don't want to hear the noon bell. I can't wait to get
back after lunch. I fly out after the big boxes to
pack the little boxes in. In my haste and ignorance
I bring back covers by mistake and pack dozens of
little boxes in covers. It must all be done over again.
Six hundred boxes I pack this day. I've not stopped
for breath. I'm not a bit tired when 6 o'clock comes
round. I ask Ida when she will put me on piecework&mdash;it
seems the great ambition of my life is to
feel I am on piecework. &#8220;When you can pack about
two thousand boxes a day,&#8221; says Ida. Two thousand!
I was panting and proud over six hundred!
&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; says Ida, &#8220;you're makin' out fine.&#8221;
Oh, the thrill of those words! I asked her to show
me again about separating the paper cups. I didn't
have it just right, I was sure. &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; sighed
Ida, &#8220;what ambition!&#8221; Yes, but the ambition did
not last more than a few days at that pitch.</p>

<p>Tessie wanted to tell me something about her <i>Mann</i>
to-day so badly, but could not find the English words.
Her joy when I said, &#8220;Tell me in German&#8221;! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
came I to speak German? I'd spent three years in
Germany with an American family, taking care of
the children. Honest for once.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was luck for you,&#8221; says Tessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was sure luck for me,&#8221; says I&mdash;honest again.</p>

<p>Wherever Lena works there floats conversation for
a radius of three tables. The subject matter is ever
the same&mdash;&#8220;dopes.&#8221; &#8220;Is he big?... Gee! I say!...
More like a sister to him.... He never sees the letters.&#8221;
&#8220;Lena&#8221; (from Ida), &#8220;shut up and get to
work!&#8221; ... &#8220;I picked him up Sunday.... Where's
them waxing papers?... Third she vamped in two
days.... Sure treats a girl swell.... Them ain't
pineapples....&#8221; &#8220;Lee-na! get to work or I'll
knock the hell out a ya!&#8221; And pretty Lena giggles
on: &#8220;He says.... She says to him.... Sure my
father says if he comes 'round again....&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tessie and I; I bend over to hear Tessie's
soft, low German as she tells me how good her <i>Mann</i>
is to her; how he never, never scolds, no matter if
she buys a new hat or what; how he brings home all
his pay every week and gives it to her. He is such a
good <i>Mann</i>. They are saving all their money. In
two years they will go back near M&uuml;nchen and buy a
little farm.</p>

<p>Tessie and her poor <i>Mann</i>, with his broken elbow
and his swollen arm all black and blue, couldn't
sleep last night. Oh dear! this New York! One man
at one corner he talk about Harding, one man other
corner he talk about Cox; one man under their window
he talk MacSwiney&mdash;New York talk, talk, talk!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Looked like rain to-day, but how can a body buy
an umbrella appropriate to chocolate packing at
thirteen dollars a week when the stores are all closed
before work and closed after? I told Lillian my
troubles. I asked Lillian if a cheap umbrella could
be purchased in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheap,&#8221; sniffs Lillian. &#8220;I don't know. I got
me a nice one&mdash;sample though&mdash;at Macy's for twelve-fifty.&#8221;
Lillian may take to her bed after supper,
but while she is awake she is going to be every inch
to the manner born.</p>

<p>By the time I pack the two thousandth box of &#8220;assorteds&#8221;
my soul turns in revolt. &#8220;If you give me
another 'assorted' to pack,&#8221; says I to Ida, &#8220;I'll lie
down here on the floor and die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hell you will,&#8221; says Ida. But she gets me
fancy pound boxes with a top and bottom layer,
scarce two candies alike, and Tessie beams on me
like a mother with an only child. &#8220;That takes the
brains!&#8221; says Tessie. &#8220;Not for me! It gives me the
ache in my head to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed it near gives me the ache in mine. Before
the next to the last row is packed the bottom looks
completely filled. Where can four fat chocolates in
cups find themselves? I push the last row over
gently to make room,&mdash;three chocolates in the middle
rear up and stand on end. Press them gently down
and two more on the first row get out of hand. At last
the last row is in&mdash;only to discover four candies here
and there have all sprung their moorings. For each
one I press down gently, another some place else acts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up. How long can my patience hold out? Firmly,
desperately I press that last obstreperous chocolate
down in its place. My finger goes squash through
the crusty brown, and pink goo oozes up and out.
A fresh strawberry heart must be found. &#8220;Ain't no
more,&#8221; announces Fannie. Might just as well tell
an artist there is only enough paint for one eye on
his beautiful portrait. Of course another chocolate
can be substituted. But a strawberry heart was
what belonged there!</p>

<p>At last the long rows of boxes are packed, wax
paper laid over each&mdash;to blow off every time Louie
goes by. Then come covers with lovely ladies in
low-neck dresses on the tops&mdash;and the room so cold,
anyhow. Why are all the pictures on all the boxes
smiling ladies in scanty attire, instead of wrapped to
the ears in fur coats so that a body might find comfort
in gazing on them in such a temperature?</p>

<p>Ida comes along and peers in one box. &#8220;You can
consider yourself a fancy packer now&mdash;see?&#8221; Harding
the night of the election felt less joyous than do
I at her words.</p>

<p>This night there is a lecture at the New School for
Social Research to be attended. If some of those
educated foreigners in our room can go to night
school, I guess I can keep up my school. They are
all foreigners but Lillian and Sadie and I. Sadie
is about the same Indian-summer stage as Lillian
and uses even better English. Her eyebrows are also
unduly black; her face looks a bit as if she had been
trying to get the ring out of the flour with her teeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Halloween. Her lips are very red. Sadie has the
air of having just missed being a Vanderbilt. Her
boudoir cap is lacy. Her smile is conscious kindness
to all as inferiors. One wonders, indeed, what
brought Sadie to packing chocolates in the autumn
of life&mdash;a very wrinkly, powdered autumn. So Lillian,
Sadie, and I are the representatives of what the
nation produces&mdash;not what she gets presented with.
As for the rest, there are a Hungarian, two Germans,
four Italians, two Spaniards, a Swede, an Englishwoman,
and numerous colored folk. Louie is an
Italian. Fannie (bless her dear heart! I love Fannie)
is colored, with freckles. She is Indian summer too&mdash;with
a heart of gold. Fannie trudges on her feet
all day. Years and years she has been there. At
noon she sits alone in the lunch room, and after eating
puts her head on her arms and, bending over the
cold marble-topped table, gets what rest she can.
She was operated on not so long ago, and every so
often still has to go to the hospital for a day or so.
Everything is at sixes and sevens when Fannie is
away.</p>

<p>So then, that night I take my sleepy way to a
lecture on &#8220;The Role of the State in Modern Civilization.&#8221;
And it comes over me in the course of the
evening, what a satisfactory thing packing chocolates
is. The role of the State&mdash;some say this, some
say that. A careful teacher guards against being
dogmatic. When it comes to the past, one interpreter
gives this viewpoint, due to certain prejudices;
another that viewpoint, due to certain other prejudices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
When it comes to the future, no sane soul
dare prophesy at all. Thus it is with much which
one studies nowadays&mdash;we have evolved beyond the
era of intellectual surety. What an almighty relief
to the soul, then, when one can pack six rows of four
chocolates each in a bottom layer, seven rows of four
chocolates each in the top, cover them, count them,
stack them, pile them in the truck, and away they
go. One job <i>done</i>&mdash;done now and forever. A definite
piece of work put behind you&mdash;and no one coming
along in six months with documents or discoveries
or new theories or practices to upset all your labors.
I say it is blessed to pack chocolates when one has
been studying labor problems for some years. Every
professor ought to have a fling at packing chocolates.</p>

<p>Folks wonder why a girl slaves in a factory when
she could be earning good money and a home thrown
in doing housework. I think of that as I watch
Annie. Imagine Annie poking about by her lonesome,
saying, &#8220;No, ma'm,&#8221; &#8220;Yes, ma'm,&#8221; &#8220;No, sir,&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; &#8220;Can I go out for a few moments, Mrs.
Jones?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, all right, ma'm!&#8221; Annie, whose talk
echoes up and down the room all day. She is Annie
to every Tom, Dick, and Harry who pokes his nose
in our packing room, but they are Tom, Dick, and
Harry to her. It is not being called by your first
name that makes the rub. It is being called it when
you must forever tack on the Mr. and the Mrs. and
the Miss. Annie is in awe of no human being. Annie
is the fastest packer in the room and draws the most
pay. Annie sasses the entire factory. Annie never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
stops talking unless she wants to. Which is only
now and then when her mother has had a bad spell
and Annie gets a bit blue. Little Pauline, an Italian,
only a few months in this country, only a few weeks
in the factory, works across the table from Annie.
Pauline is the next quickest packer in our room. She
cannot speak a word of English. Annie gives a sigh
audible from one end of the room to the next. &#8220;My
Gawd!&#8221; moans Annie to the entire floor. &#8220;If this
here Eyetalian don't learn English pretty soon I gotta
learn Eyetalian. I can't stand here like a dead one
all day with nobody to talk to.&#8221; Pauline might perhaps
be reasoning that, after all, why learn English,
since she would never get a silent moment in which
to practice any of it.</p>

<p>I very much love little Pauline. All day long her
fingers fly; all day long not a word does she speak,
only every now and then little Pauline turns around
to me and we smile at each other. Once on the street,
a block or so from the factory, little Pauline ran up
to me, put her arm through mine, and caught my
hand. So we walked to work. Neither could say
a word to the other. Each just smiled and smiled.
For the first time in all my life I really felt the melting
pot first hand. To Pauline I was no agent of Americanization,
no superior proclaiming the need of bathtubs
and clean teeth, no teacher of the &#8220;Star-spangled
banner&#8221; and the Constitution. To Pauline
I was a fellow-worker, and she must know, for such
things are always known, that I loved her. To myself,
I felt suddenly the hostess&mdash;the generation-long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
inhabitant of this land so new and strange to little
Pauline. She was my guest here. I would indeed
have her care for my country, have her glad she came
to my home. That day Pauline turned around and
smiled more often than before.</p>

<p>I finally settled down to eating lunch daily between
Tessie and Mrs. Lewis, the Englishwoman. We do
so laugh at one another's jokes. I know everything
that ever happened to Tessie and Mrs. Lewis from
the time they were born; all the heartbreaking stories
of the first homesick months in this my land, all the
jobs they have labored at. Mrs. Lewis has worked
&#8220;in the mills&#8221; ever since she was born, it would
seem, first in England, later in Michigan. Tessie
and her husband mostly have hired out together in
this country for housework, and she likes that better
than packing chocolates standing up, she says. Mrs.
Lewis is&mdash;well, she's Indian summer, too, along with
Lillian and Sadie and Fannie, only she makes no
bones about it (nor does black Fannie, for that
matter). Mrs. Lewis is thin and wrinkled, with a
skimpy little dust cap on her head. Her nose is very
long and pointed, her teeth very false. Her eyes are
always smiling. She loves to laugh. One day we
were talking about unemployment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you know, it's awful in Europe,&#8221; volunteers
Mrs. Lewis.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred thousand unemployed in Paris
alone&mdash;saw it in headlines this morning,&#8221; I advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paris?&#8221; said Tessie. &#8220;Paris? Where's Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>If one could always be so sure of one's facts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;France.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis wheels about in her chair, looks at me
sternly over the top of her spectacles, and:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, they're telling me that's a pretty
fast country, that France.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't say!&#8221; I look interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no I haven't got the details <i>yet</i>&#8221;&mdash;she
clasped her chin with her hand&mdash;&#8220;but 'fast' was the
word I heard used.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene is a large, florid, bleached blonde. She
worked at the table behind me about four days.
&#8220;Y'know&#8221;&mdash;Irene has a salon air&mdash;&#8220;y'know, I jus'
can't stand steppen on these soft chocolates. Nobody
knows how I suffer. It just goes through me
like a knife.&#8221; She spent a good part of each day
scraping off the bottoms of her French-heeled shoes
with a piece of cardboard. It evidently was too
much for her nerves. She is no more.</p>

<p>The sign reads, &#8220;Saturdays 8-12.&#8221; When Saturday
came around Ida hollered down the room,
&#8220;Everybody's gotta work to-day till five.&#8221; The howl
that went up! I supposed &#8220;gotta&#8221; meant &#8220;gotta.&#8221;
But Lena came up to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gonna work till five? Don't you do it. We
had to strike to get a Saturday half holiday. Now
they're tellin' us we gotta work till five&mdash;pay us for
it, o' course. If enough girls'll stay, pretty soon
they'll be sayin: 'See? What ud we tell ya? The
girls want to work Saturday afternoons'; and they'll
have us back regular again.&#8221; In the end not a girl
in our room stayed, and Ida wrung her hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Monday next, though, Ida announced, &#8220;Everybody's
gotta work till seven to-night 'cause ya all
went home Saturday afternoon. Three nights a
week now you gotta work till seven.&#8221; To stand from
1 to 7! One girl in the room belonged to some union
or other. She called out, &#8220;Will they pay time and
a half for overtime?&#8221; At which everyone broke into
laughter. &#8220;Gee! Ida, here's a girl wants time and
a half!&#8221; Tessie, Mrs. Lewis, Sadie, and I refused to
work till 7. Ida used threats and argument. &#8220;I
gotta put down your numbers!&#8221; We stood firm&mdash;6
o'clock was long enough. &#8220;Gee! You don't notice
that last hour&mdash;goes like a second,&#8221; argued Ida.
We filed out when the 6-o'clock bell rang.</p>

<p>The girls all fuss over the hour off at noon. It
takes at best twenty minutes to eat lunch. For the
rest of the hour there is no place to go, nothing to
do, but sit in the hard chairs at the marble-topped
tables in the whitewashed room for half an hour till
the bell rings at 12.50, and you can sit on the edge of
a truck upstairs for ten minutes longer. They all
say they wish to goodness we could have half an hour
at noon and get off half an hour earlier at night.</p>


<p class="thought">A tragedy the first pay day. I was so excited when
that Saturday came round, to see what it would all
be like&mdash;to get my first pay envelope. About 11.30
two men came in, one carrying a wooden box filled
with little envelopes. Girls appear suddenly from
every place and crowd around the two men. One
calls out a number, the girl takes her envelope and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
goes off. I keep working away, thinking you are not
supposed to step up till your number is called. But,
lo! everyone seems paid off and the men departing,
whereat I leave my work with beating heart and
announce: &#8220;You didn't call 1075.&#8221; But it seems I
was supposed to step up and give 1075. I get handed
my little envelope. Connie Parker in one corner,
1075 in the other, the date, and $6.81. Six dollars
and eighty-one cents, and I had expected fourteen
dollars. (I had told Ida at last that I thought I
ought to get fourteen dollars, and she thought so,
too, and said she'd &#8220;speak to the man&#8221; about it.)
I clutched Ida&mdash;&#8220;only six dollars and eighty one
cents!&#8221; &#8220;Well, what more do ya want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said fourteen dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems the week goes Thursday to Thursday,
instead of Monday to Saturday, so my first pay
covered only three days and a deduction for my
locker key.</p>

<p>At that moment a little cry just behind me from
Louisa. Louisa had been packing with Irene&mdash;dark
little, frail little Yiddish Louisa; big brawny bleached-blond
Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I've lost my pay envelope!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wan little Louisa! She had been talking to
Topsy, Fannie's helper. Her envelope had slipped
out of her waist, and when she went to pick it up, lo!
there was nothing there to pick&mdash;fourteen dollars
gone! There was excitement for you. Fourteen
dollars in Wing 13, Room 3, was equal to fourteen
million dollars in Wall Street. Everybody pulled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
out boxes and searched, got down on hands and knees
and poked, and the rest mauled Louisa from head to
foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it ain't in your stocking? Well, look <i>again</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's this?&#8221;&mdash;jabbing Louisa's ribs&mdash;&#8220;this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eight hands going over Louisa's person as if the
anguished slip of a girl could not have felt that stiff
envelope with fourteen dollars in it herself had it
been there. She stood helpless, woebegone.</p>

<p>Ida rose Napoleon-like to the rescue. &#8220;I'll search
everybody in the room!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat she made a grab at Topsy and removed
her. &#8220;They&#8221; say Topsy was stripped to the breezes
in Ida's fury, but no envelope.</p>

<p>Topsy, be it known, was already a suspicious
character. That very week Fannie's purse had disappeared
under circumstances pointing to Topsy.
Which caused a strained relationship between the
two. One day it broke&mdash;such relationship as existed.</p>

<p>Fannie up at her end of the boxes was heard to
screech down the line to where Topsy was sorting
chocolate rolls:</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you talk to me like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain't talkin' to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You am. You called me names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never. I called you nothin', you ole white
nigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stand lie to me like that and call me names?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who say lie? I ain't no liar. You shut up; you
ain't my boss. I'll call you anythin' I please, sassin'
me that way!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't sassed you. You called me names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't care what I called you&mdash;I know what you
<i>is</i>.&#8221; Here Topsy gathered all her strength and
shouted up to Fannie, &#8220;You're a <i>heifer</i>, you is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there is much I do not know about the
world, and maybe heifer is a word like some one or
two others you are never supposed to set down in so
many letters. If so, it is new to me and I apologize.
The way Topsy called it, and the way Fannie acted
on hearing herself called it, would lead one to believe
it is a word never appearing in print.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;call&mdash;me a <i>heifer</i>?&#8221; shrieked Fannie. &#8220;I'll
tell ya landlady on ya, I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don' yo' go mixin' up in my private affairs.
You shut yo' mouth, yo' hear me? yo' <i>heifer</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>ain't</i> no heifer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately Ida swung into our midst about then
and saved folk from bodily injury. A few days later
Fanny informed me privately that she don't say
nothin' when that nigger starts rowin' with her, but
if she jus' has her tin lunch box with her next time
when that nigger starts talkin' fresh&mdash;callin' her a
heifer&mdash;<i>her!</i>&mdash;she'll slug her right 'cross the face
with it.</p>

<p>So Topsy was searched. When she got her garments
back on she appeared at the door&mdash;a small
black goddess of fury. &#8220;Yo' fresh Ida, yo'&mdash;yessa&mdash;yo'
jus' searched me 'cause I'm black. That's all,
'cause I'm black. Why don't you search all that
white trash standin' there?&#8221; And Topsy flung herself
out. Monday she appeared with a new maroon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
embroidered suit. Cost every nickel of thirty-eight
dollars, Fannie informed me. In the packing room
she had a hat pin in her cap. Some girl heard Topsy
tell some other girls she was going stick that pin
in Fannie if Fannie got sassin' her again. Ida made
her remove the hat pin. In an hour she disappeared
altogether and stayed disappeared forever after.
&#8220;Went South,&#8221; Fannie told me. &#8220;Always said she
was goin' South when cold weather started....
Huh! Thought she'd stick me with a hat pin. I was
carryin' a board around all mornin'. If she so
much as come near me I was goin' to give her a crack
aside the head.&#8221;</p>


<p class="thought">But there was little Louisa&mdash;and no longer could
she keep back the tears. Nor could ever the pay
envelope be unearthed. Later I found her sitting
on the pile of dirty towels in the washroom, sobbing
her heart out. It was not so much that the money
was gone&mdash;that was awful enough&mdash;fourteen dollars!&mdash;fourteen
dollars!&mdash;oh-h-h,&mdash;but her mother and
father&mdash;what would they do to her when she came
home and told 'em? They mightn't believe it was
lost and think she'd spent it on somethin' for herself.
The tears streamed down her face. And that was
the last we ever saw of Louisa.</p>

<p>Had &#8220;local color&#8221; been all we were after, perhaps
Wing 13, Room 3, would have supplied sufficient of
that indefinitely, with the combination of the ever-voluble
Lena and the ever-present labor turnover.
Even more we desired to learn the industrial feel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the thing&mdash;what do some of the million and more
factory women think about the world of work?
Remaining longer in Wing 13 would give no deeper
clue to that. For all that I could find out, the candy
workers there thought nothing about it one way or
the other. The younger unmarried girls worked because
it seemed the only thing to do&mdash;they or their
families needed the money, and what would they be
doing otherwise? Lena claimed, if she could have her
way in the world, she would sleep until 12 every day
and go to a show every afternoon. But that life
would pall even on Lena, and she giggled wisely when
I slangily suggested as much.</p>

<p>The older married women worked either because
they had to, since the male breadwinner was disabled
(an old fat Irishwoman at the chocolate dipper
had a husband with softening of the brain. He was
a discharged English soldier who &#8220;got too much in
the sun in India&#8221;) or because his tenure of job was
apt to be uncertain and they preferred to take no
chances. Especially with the feel and talk of unemployment
in the air, two jobs were better than none.
A few, like Mrs. Lewis, worked to lay by toward their
old age. Mrs. Lewis's husband had a job, but his
wages permitted of little or no savings. Some of her
friends told her: &#8220;Oh, well, somebody's bound to
look out for you somehow when you get old. They
don't let you die of hunger and cold!&#8221; But Mrs.
Lewis was not so sure. She preferred to save herself
from hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Such inconveniences of the job as existed were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
taken as being all in the day's work&mdash;like the rain or
a cold in the head. At some time they must have
shown enough ability for temporary organization to
strike for the Saturday half holiday. I wish I could
have been there when that affair was on. Which
girls were the ringleaders? How much agitation
and exertion did it take to acquire the momentum
which would result in enforcing their demands? Had
I entered factory work with any idea of encouraging
organization among female factory workers, I should
have considered that candy group the most hopeless
soil imaginable. Those whom I came in contact
with had no class feeling, no ideas of grievances, no
ambitions over and above the doing of an uninteresting
job with as little exertion as possible.</p>

<p>I hated leaving Tessie and Mrs. Lewis and little
Pauline. Already I miss the life behind those candy
scenes. For the remainder of my days a box of
chocolates will mean a very personal&mdash;almost too
personal for comfort!&mdash;thing to me. But for the rest
of the world....</p>


<p class="thought">Some place, some moonlight night, some youth,
looking like a collar advertisement, will present his
fair love with a pound box of fancy assorted chocolates&mdash;in
brown paper cups; and assured of at least
a generous disposition, plus his lovely collar-advertisement
hair, she will say yes. On the sofa, side by
side, one light dimly shining, the nightingale singing
in the sycamore tree beside the front window, their
two hearts will beat as one&mdash;for the time being.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
They will eat the chocolates I packed and life will
seem a very sweet and peaceful thing indeed. Nor
will any disturbing notion of how my feet felt ever
reach them, no jarring &#8220;you heifer!&#8221; float across the
states to where they sit. Louie to them does not
exist&mdash;Louie, forever on the run with, &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, move
these trays!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, bottoms!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, tops!&#8221;
&#8220;<i>Louie</i>, cardboards!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, the truck!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>,
sweep the floor! How many times I told you that
to-day!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, get me a box a' ca'mels, that's a
good dope!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, turn out them lights!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>,
turn on them lights!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, ya leave things settin'
round like that!&#8221; &#8220;<i>Louie</i>, where them covers?&#8221;
and then Louie smashes his fingers and retires for
ten minutes.</p>

<p>Nor is Ida more than a strange name to those two
on the sofa. No echoes reach them of, &#8220;Ida, where
them wax papers?&#8221; &#8220;Ida, where's Fannie?&#8221; &#8220;Ida,
where them picture tops?&#8221; &#8220;Ida, ain't no more
'coffees.' What'll I use instead?&#8221; &#8220;Ida! Where's
Ida? Mike wants ya by the elevator.&#8221; &#8220;Ida, I
jus' packed sixty; ten sixty-two is my number.&#8221;
&#8220;Ida, Joe says they want 'drops' on the fifth.&#8221; &#8220;Ida,
ain't no more trays.&#8221; &#8220;Ida, gimme the locker-door
key. 'M cold&mdash;want ma sweater. (Gee! it 'u'd freeze
the stuffin' outa ya in this ice box!)&#8221;</p>

<p>Those chocolates appeared in a store window in
Watertown, and that's enough. Not for their moonlit
souls the clang of the men building a new dipper
and roller in our room&mdash;the bang of the blows of
metal on metal as they pierce your soul along about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
5 of a weary afternoon. Lena's giggles and Ida's
&#8220;Lee-na, stop your talk and go to work!... Louie,
stop your whistlin'!... My Gawd! girls, don' you
know no better n' to put two kinds in the same box? ...
Hey, Lena, this yere Eyetalian wants somethin';
come here and find out what's ailin' her.... Fannie,
ain't there no more plantations?... Who left that
door open?... Louie, for Gawd's sake how long you
gonna take with that truck?... Lena, stop your
talkin' and go to work....&#8221;</p>

<p>And 'round here, there, and every place, &#8220;My
Gawd! my feet are like ice!&#8221; &#8220;Say, len' me some of
yo'r cardboards&mdash;hey?&#8221; &#8220;You Pearl White [black
as night], got the tops down there?&#8221; &#8220;Hey, Ida, the
Hungarian girl wants somethin'. I can't understand
her....&#8221;</p>

<p>Those two sit on the sofa. The moon shines on
the nightingale singing in the sycamore tree. Nor
do they ever glimpse a vision of little Italian Pauline's
swift fingers dancing over the boxes, nor do
they ever guess of wan Louisa's sobs.</p>

<h4><i>286 On Brass</i></h4>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>weetness</span> and Light.</p>

<p>So now appears the candy factory in retrospect.</p>

<p>Shall we stumble upon a job yet that will make
brass seem as a haven of refuge? Allah forbid!</p>

<p>After all, factory work, more than anything so
far, has brought out the fact that life from beginning
to end is a matter of comparisons. The factory girl,
from my short experience, is not fussing over what
her job looks like compared to tea at the Biltmore.
She is comparing it with the last job or with home.
And it is either slightly better or slightly worse than
the last job or home. Any way round, nothing to get
excited over. An outsider, soul-filled college graduate
with a mission, investigates a factory and calls aloud
to Heaven: &#8220;Can such things be? Why do women
<i>stay</i> in such a place?&#8221;</p>

<p>The factory girl, if she heard those anguished
cries, would as like as not shrug her shoulders and
remark: &#8220;Ugh! she sh'u'dda seen &mdash;&mdash;'s factory
where I worked a year ago.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Gawd! what does
she think a person's goin' to do&mdash;sit home all day and
scrub the kitchen?&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet the fact remains that some things get too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
much on even a philosophical factory girl's nerves.
Whereat she merely walks out&mdash;if she has gumption
enough. The labor turnover, from the point of view
of production and efficiency, can well be a vital industrial
concern. To the factory girl, it saves her
life, like as not. Praise be the labor turnover!</p>

<p>If it were not for that same turnover, I, like the
soul-filled college graduate, might feel like calling
aloud, not to Heaven, but to the President of the
United States and Congress and the Church and
Women's clubs: &#8220;Come quick and rescue females
from the brassworks!&#8221; As it is, the females rescue
themselves. If there's any concern it's &#8220;the boss he
should worry.&#8221; He must know how every night
girls depart never to cross those portals again, so
help them Gawd. Every morning a new handful is
broken in, to stay there a week or two, if that long,
and take to their heels. Praise be the labor turnover,
as long as we have such brassworks.</p>

<p>Before eight o'clock of a cold Monday morning
(thank goodness it was not raining, since we stood in
shivering groups on the sidewalk) I answered the
Sunday-morning &#8220;ad&#8221;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">GIRLS AND WOMEN</p>


<p style="text-indent: 0em">between 16 and 36; learners and experienced assemblers and
foot-press operators on small brass parts; steady; half day
Saturday all year around; good pay and bonus. Apply Superintendent's
office.</p></div>

<p>The first prospects were rather formidable&mdash;some
fifty men and boys, no other girl or woman. Soon
two cold females made their appearance and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
shivered together and got acquainted in five minutes,
as is wont under the circumstances. One rawboned
girl with a crooked nose and frizzled blond hair had
been married just two months. She went into immediate
details about a party at her sister-in-law's
the night before, all ending at a dance hall. The
pretty, plump Jewess admitted she had never
danced.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; almost yelled the bride, &#8220;Never <i>danced</i>?
Good Gawd! girl, you might as well be <i>dead</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; I chimed in. &#8220;Might as well dig
a hole in the ground and crawl in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; and the husky bride and erstwhile
(up to the week before) elevator operator at twenty-three
dollars a week (she said) gave me a smart
thump of understanding. &#8220;Girl, you never <i>danced</i>?
It's&mdash;it's the grandest thing in <i>life</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The plump Jewess looked a little out of things. &#8220;I
know,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;they tell me it 'u'd make me
thin, too, but my folks don't let me go out no place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat we changed to polishing off profiteers and
the high cost of living. The Jewish girl's brother
knew we were headin' straight for civil war. &#8220;They'll
be comin' right in folks' homes and killen 'em before
a year's out. See if they don't.&#8221; I asked her if she'd
ever worked in a union shop. &#8220;Na, none of that stuff
for me! Wouldn't go near a union.&#8221; Both girls
railed over the way people were losing their jobs.
Anyhow, the bride was goin' to a dance that night,
you jus' bet.</p>

<p>At last some one with a heart came out and told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the girls we could step inside. By that time there
were some ten of us, all ages and descriptions. What
would a &#8220;typical&#8221; factory girl be like, I wonder.
Statistics prove she is young and unmarried more
than otherwise, but each factory does seem to collect
the motleyest crew of a little of everything&mdash;old,
young, married, single, homely, stupid, bright,
pretty, sickly, husky, fat, thin, and so on down the
line. Certain it is that they who picture a French-heeled,
fur-coated, dolled-up creature as the &#8220;typical
factory girl&#8221; are far wide of the mark. The one
characteristic which so far does seem pretty universal
is that one and all, no matter what the age or
looks, are perfectly willing to tell you everything
they know on short acquaintance. At first I felt a
hesitancy at asking questions about their personal
lives, yet I so much wanted to know what they did
and thought, what they hoped and dreamed about.
It was early apparent that sooner or later everything
would come out with scant encouragement,
and no amount of questioning ever is taken amiss.
They in turn ask me questions, and I lie until I hate
myself.</p>

<p>The plump Jewess was the first interviewed. When
she heard the pay she departed. The elevator bride
and I were taken together, and together we agreed to
everything&mdash;wages thirteen dollars a week, &#8220;with
one dollar a week bonus&#8221; (the bonus, as was later
discovered, had numerous strings to it. I never did
get any). Work began at 7.45, half hour for lunch,
ended at 5. The bride asked if the work was dangerous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
&#8220;That's up to you. Goin' upstairs is dangerous
if you don't watch where you put your feet. Eh?&#8221;
We wanted to start right in&mdash;I had my apron under
my arm&mdash;but to-morrow would be time. I got quite
imploring about beginning on that day. No use.</p>

<p>The bride and I departed with passes to get by
with the next morning. That was the last I saw of
the bride&mdash;or any of that group, except one little
frozen thing without a hat. She worked three days,
and used to pull my apron every time she went by
and grin.</p>

<p>The factory was 'way over on the East Side. It
meant gettin' up in the dark and three Subways&mdash;West
Side, the Shuttle, East Side which could be
borne amicably in the morning, but after eight and
three-quarter hours of foot-press work, going home
with that 5-6 rush&mdash;that mob who shoved and elbowed
and pushed and jammed&mdash;was difficult to
bear with Christian spirit. Except that it really is
funny. What idea of human nature must a Subway
guard between the hours of 5 and 6 be possessed of?</p>

<p>At noon I used to open my lunch anxiously, expecting
to see nothing but a doughy mass of crumpled
rye bread and jam. Several times on the Subway the
apple got shoved into my ribs over a period where it
seemed as if either the apple or the ribs would have
to give in. But by noon my hunger was such that
any state of anything edible was as nectar and
ambrosia.</p>

<p>I am thinking that even a hardened factory hand
might remember her first day at the brassworks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Up three flights of stairs, through a part of the men's
factory, over a narrow bridge to a back building,
through two little bobbing doors, and there you were
admitted to that sanctuary where, according to the
man who hired you, steady work and advancement to
a rosy future awaited one.</p>

<p>True, I had only the candy factory as a basis of
comparison, as far as working experience went.
But I have been through factories and factories of all
sorts and descriptions, and nothing had I ever seen
like the brassworks. First was the smell&mdash;the stale
smell of gas and metal. (Perhaps there is no such
smell as stale metal, but you go down to the brassworks
and describe it better!) Second, the darkness&mdash;a
single green-shaded electric light directly over
where any girl was working, but there were areas
where there were no workers. Up the end of the
floor, among the power presses, all belts and machines
and whirring wheels, there were only three or four
shaded lights. Windows lined both sides of the
floor, but they had never been washed since the factory
was built, surely. Anyhow, it was dark and
rainy outside. The walls once had been white, but
were now black. Dim, dirty, uneven boxes containing
brass parts filled the spaces between the long
tables where the foot presses stood. Third, the noise&mdash;the
clump of the foot presses, the whirring of the
pattern cutters&mdash;one sounded ever like a lusty woodpecker
with a metal beak pecking on metal; rollings
and rumblings from the floor above; jarrings and
shakings from below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Two-thirds of the entire floor was filled with long
tables holding the foot presses&mdash;tables which years
ago were clean and new, tables which now were worn,
stained, and uneven, and permanently dirty. On
each side of each long table stood five black iron
presses, but there seemed to be never more than one
or two girls working at a side. Each press performed
a different piece of work&mdash;cut wick holes,
fitted or clamped parts together, shaped the cones,
and what not, but with only two general types of
operation so far as the foot part went. One type
took a long, firm, forward swing on the pedal; the
other a short, hard, downward &#8220;kick.&#8221; With the
end of the pressure the steel die cut through the thin
brass cone, or completed whatever the job was. As
the pedal and foot swung back to position the girl
removed the brass part, dropping it in a large box
at her right. She kept a small bin on the table at
the left of the press filled with parts she was to work
on. Around the sides of the floor were the table
workers&mdash;girls adjusting parts by hand, or soldering.</p>

<p>The other third of the floor was taken up with the
machine presses, which mostly clicked away cutting
patterns in the brass parts to hold the lamp chimney.
In a far corner were the steaming, bleaching
tubs where dull, grimy brass parts were immersed
in several preparations, I don't know what, to
emerge at last shining like the noonday sun.</p>

<p>The cold little girl with no hat, a strange, somewhat
unsociable, new person, and I stood there
waiting one hour. Some one took our names. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
experienced feeling when they asked me where I
had worked last and how long was I there, and why
did I leave! At the end of an hour the forelady
beckoned me&mdash;such a neat, sweet person as she was&mdash;and
I took my initial whack at a foot press. If ever
I do run an automobile the edge of first enjoyment is
removed. A Rolls-Royce cannot make me feel any
more pleased with life than the first ten minutes of
that foot press. In ten minutes the job was all done
and there I sat for an hour and a half waiting for
another. Hard on a person with the foot-press fever.
The times and times later I would gratefully have
taken any part of that hour and a half to ease my
weary soul!</p>

<p>Be it known, if I speak feelingly at times of the
weariness of a foot press, that, though nothing as to
size, I am a very husky person&mdash;perhaps the healthiest
of the eight million women in industry! It was
a matter of paternal dismay that I arrived in the
world female instead of male. What Providence had
overlooked, mortal ability would do everything possible
to make up for&mdash;so argued a disappointed
father. From four years of age on I was taught to
do everything a boy could or would do; from jumping
off cars while they were moving to going up in a
balloon. A good part of my life I have played tennis
and basketball and hockey, and swum, and climbed
mountains, and ridden horseback, and rowed, and
fished. I do not know what it is to have an ache or
a pain from one end of the year to the other. All of
which is mentioned merely because if certain work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
taxes my strength, who seldom has known what it
is to be weary, what can it do to the average factory
worker, often without even a fighting physical chance
from birth on?</p>

<p>The jobs on our third floor where the girls and
women worked concerned themselves with lamps&mdash;the
old-fashioned kind, city folks are apt to think.
Yet goodness knows we seemed during even my sojourn
to make more lamp parts than creation ever
had used in the heyday of lamps. Well, all but five
per cent of farm women still use kerosene lamps, so
the government tells us. Also fat Lizzie informed
me, when I asked her who in the world could ever use
just them lamp cones I made some one particular
day, &#8220;Lor', child, they send them lamps all over the
world!&#8221; She made a majestic sweep with both arms.
&#8220;Some of 'em goes as far&mdash;as far&mdash;as <i>Philadelphia</i>!&#8221;
Once we were working on a rush order for fifty thousand
lamps of one certain kind. Curiosity got the
better of me and I took occasion to see where the
boxes were being addressed. It was to a large mail-order
house in Chicago.</p>

<p>The first noon whistle&mdash;work dropped&mdash;a rush for
the washroom. Let no one think his hands ever
were dirty until he labors at a foot press in a brassworks.
Such sticky, grimy, oily, rough blackness
never was&mdash;and the factory supplies no soap nor
towels. You are expected to bring your own&mdash;which
is all right the second day when you have found it
out and come prepared.</p>

<p>The third floor had seemed dark and dismal enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
during the morning; at noon all lights are turned off.
Many of the workers went out for lunch, the rest got
around in dismal corners, most of them singly, and
ate by their machines, on the same hard seats they
have been on since a quarter to 8. What a bacchanal
festival of color and beauty now appeared
the candy-factory whitewashed lunch room with the
marble-topped tables! The airy sociability of it!
I wandered about with my lunch in my hand, to see
what I could see. Up amid the belts and power
machines sat one of the girls who began that morning&mdash;not
the cold, hatless one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gonna stick it out?&#8221; she asked me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I guess it's all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh gee! Ain't like no place I ever worked yet.
Don't catch me standin' this long.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did stand it four days. Minnie suggested then
she stick it out till Christmas. &#8220;You'll need the
money for Christmas y'know, an' you might not get
the next job so easy now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn Christmas!&#8221; was all the new girl had to
say to that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure now,&#8221; said Irish Minnie, &#8220;an' she's takin
her chances. It's an awful disgrace y'know, to be
gettin' presents when y'ain't got none to give back.
Ain't it, now? I'd never take no chances on a job
so close to Christmas.&#8221;</p>

<p>I talked to five girls that noon. None of them had
been there longer than a week. None of them
planned to stay.</p>

<p>All afternoon I worked the foot press at one job.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
My foot-press enthusiasm weakened&mdash;four thousand
times I &#8220;kicked&#8221;&mdash;two thousand lamp-wick slots I
make in the cones. Many of the first five hundred
looked a bit sad and chewed at. The &#8220;boss&#8221; came
by and saw that I was not one hundred per cent perfect.
He gave me pointers and I did better. Each cone got
placed over a slanted form just so; kick, and half the
slot is made. Lift the cone up a wee bit, twist it
round to an exact position, hold it in place, kick, and
the other half is cut. The kick must be a stout kick&mdash;bing!
down hard, to make a clean job of it. The
thing they gave you to sit on! A high, narrow, homemade-looking,
wooden stool, the very hardest article
of furniture under the blue canopy of heaven. Some
of them had little, narrow, straight backs&mdash;just
boards nailed on behind. All of them were top heavy
and fell over if you got off without holding on. By
4.30 standing up at the candy job seemed one of the
happiest thoughts on earth. What rosy good old
days those were! Dear old candy factory! Happy
girls back there bending over the chocolates!</p>

<p>Next sat Louisa, an Italian girl who stuttered, and
I had to stop my press to hear her. She stopped hers
to talk. She should worry. It's the worst job she ever
saw, and for thirteen dollars a week why should she
work? She talked to me, kicked a few times, got a drink,
kicked, talked, stood up and stretched, kicked, talked,
got another drink. She is married, has a baby a year
old, another coming in three months. She will stay
her week out, then she goes, you bet. Her husband
was getting fifty dollars a week in a tailor job&mdash;no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
work now for t-t-t-two months. He does a little
now and then in the b-b-barber business. Oh, but
life was high while the going was good! She leaned
way over and told me in a hushed, inspired tone, to
leave me awestruck, &#8220;When we was m-m-married we
t-t-took a h-h-h-honeymoon!&#8221; I gasped and wanted
details. To West Virginia they'd gone for a month.
The fare alone, each way, had come to ten dollars
apiece, and then they did no work for that month,
but lived in a little hotel. Her husband was crazy
of her, and she was of him now, but not when she
was married. He's very good to her. After dinner
every single night they go to a show.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, every night, and Sundays two times.&#8221;</p>

<p>It all sounded truly glowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don' you do it. Wish I wasn't married.
Oh gee! Wish I wasn't married. I'm crazy of my
husband, but I wish I wasn't married. See&mdash;once
you married&mdash;pisht!&mdash;there you are&mdash;stay that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed I was in no hurry about matrimony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry? Na, no hurry; that's right. The h-h-hurrier
you are the b-b-b-badder off you get!&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning the Italian girl was late. The
forelady gave her locker to some one else. Such a
row! Louisa said: &#8220;I got mad, I did. I told her to
go to hell. That's only w-w-w-way anybody gets
anything in this world&mdash;get mad and say you go to
h-h-hell. Betcha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later the forelady, when the Italian was on
one of her trips after a drink, leaned over and gave
me her side of the story. She is such a very nice
person, our forelady&mdash;quiet, attractive, neat as a
pin. Her sister addresses boxes and does clerical
work of one sort or another. Two subdued old maids
they are; never worked any place but right on our
third floor. &#8220;Ain't like what it used to be,&#8221; she told
me. &#8220;In the old days girls used to work here till
they got married. We used to have parties here
and, say! they was nice girls in them days. Look at
'em now! Such riffraff! New ones comin' in all the
time, new ones worse each time. Riffraff, that's
what they are. It sure looks nice to see a girl like
you.&#8221; (What good were the earrings doing?) &#8220;We'll
make it just as nice here for you as we can.&#8221; (Oh, how
guilty I began to feel!)</p>

<p>She looked around to see if the Italian was about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you take this Eyetalian girl next to you.
Gee! she's some fright. Oughtta heard her this
morning. 'Spected me to keep her locker for her
when she was late. How'd I know she was comin'
back? I gave it to another girl. She comes tearin'
at me. 'What the hell you think you're doin'?'
she says to me. Now I ain't used to such talk, and
I was for puttin' my hat and coat on right then and
there and walkin' out. I must say I gotta stand all
sorts of things in my job. It's awful what I gotta
put up with. I never says nothin' to her. But any
girl's a fool 'l talk to a person that way. Shows she's
got nothin' up here [knocking her head] or she sure'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
know better than get the forelady down on her like
that. Gee! I was mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Louisa returned and Miss Hibber moved on.
&#8220;Some fright, that forelady,&#8221; remarked Louisa.
That night Louisa departed for good.</p>

<p>The second day I kicked over six thousand times.
It seemed a lot when you think of the hard stool.
It was a toss between which was the worse, the stool
or the air. This afternoon, I was sure it must be
3.30. I looked back at the clock&mdash;1.10. It had
seemed like two hours of work and it was forty minutes.
No ventilation whatever in that whole room&mdash;not
a crack of air. Wonder if there ever was any
since the place was built decades ago. Once Louisa
and I became desperate and got Tony to open a
window. The forelady had a fit; so did Tillie.
Both claimed they'd caught cold.</p>

<p>Tony is the Louis of the brassworks. He is young
and very lame&mdash;one leg considerably shorter than
the other. It makes me miserable to see him packing
heavy boxes about. He told me he must get another
job or quit. Finally they did put him at a small
machine press. So many maimed and halt and decrepit
as they employed about the works! Numbers
of the workers were past-telling old, several were
very lame, one errand boy had a fearfully deformed
face, one was cross-eyed. I remarked to Minnie
that the boss of the works must have a mighty
good heart. Minnie has been working twenty-three
years and has had the bloom of admiration for
her fellow-beings somewhat worn off in that time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
&#8220;Hm!&#8221; grunted Minnie. &#8220;He gets 'em cheaper
that way, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elevator man is no relation to the one at the
candy factory. He is red faced and grinning, most
of his teeth are gone, and he always wears a derby
hat over one eye. One morning I was late. He
jerked his head and thumb toward the elevator.
&#8220;Come on, I'll give ya a lift up!&#8221; and when we
reached our floor, though it was the men's side,
&#8220;Third Avenue stop!&#8221; he called out cheerily, and
grinned at the world. He had been there for years.
The boss on our floor had been there for years&mdash;forty-three,
to be exact. Miss Hibber would not tell
how many years she had worked there, nor would
Tillie. Tillie said she was born there.</p>

<p>If it were only the human element that counted,
everyone would stay at the brassworks forever. I
feel like a snake in the grass, walking off &#8220;on them&#8221;
when they all were so nice. Nor was it for a moment
the &#8220;dearie&#8221; kind of niceness that made you feel it
was orders from above. From our floor boss down,
they were people who were born to treat a body
square. All the handicaps against them&mdash;the work
itself, the surroundings, the low pay&mdash;had so long
been part of their lives, these &#8220;higher ups&#8221; seemed
insensible to the fact that such things were handicaps.</p>

<p>To-day was sunny and the factory not so dark&mdash;in
fact, part of the time we worked with no electric
lights. The crisp early morning air those four blocks
from the Subway to the factory&mdash;it sent the spring
fever through the blood. In the gutter of that dirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
East Side street a dirty East Side man was burning
garbage. The smoke curled up lazily. The sun just
peeping up over the hospital at the end of the street
made slanting shafts through the smoke. As I
passed by it suddenly was no longer the East Side
of New York City....</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the Four Way Lodge is open,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the hunting winds are loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the smokes of spring go up to clear the brain....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Breakfast in a ca&ntilde;on by the side of a stream&mdash;the
odor of pines.... The little bobbing doors went to
behind me and there I stood in floor three, the stale
gas and metal smell ... the whirs of the belts ... the
jarring of the presses....</p>

<p>Next to me this glorious morning sat a snip of a
little thing all in black&mdash;so pretty she was, so very
pretty. I heard the boss tell her it's not the sort of
work she's been used to, she'll find it hard. Is she
sure she wants to try it? And in the course of the
morning I heard the story of Mame's life.</p>

<p>Mame's husband died three weeks ago. They had
been married one month and two days&mdash;after waiting
three years. Shall I write a story of Mame on the
sob-sister order to bring the tears to your eyes? It
could easily be done. But not honestly. Little
Mame&mdash;how could her foot ever reach the press?
And when she walked off after a drink, I saw that
she was quite lame. A widow only three weeks.
She'd never worked before, but there was no money.
She lived all alone, wandered out for her meals&mdash;no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mother, no father, no sisters or brothers. She cried
every night. Her husband had been a traveling
salesman&mdash;sometimes he made eighty-five dollars a
week. They had a six-room apartment and a servant!
She'd met him at a dance hall. A girl she
was with had dared her to wink at him. Sure she'd
do anything anybody dared her to. He came over
and asked her what she was after, anyhow. That
night he left the girl he'd taken to the dance hall to
pilot her own way back to home and mother, and he
saw Mame to her room. He was swell and tall.
She showed me his picture in a locket around her
neck. Meanwhile Mame kicked the foot press about
twice every five minutes.</p>

<p>Why had they waited so long to get married?
Because of the war. He was afraid he'd be killed
and would leave her a widow. &#8220;He asked me to
promise never to get married again if he did marry
me and died. But,&#8221;&mdash;she leaned over my way&mdash;&#8220;that
only meant if he died during the war, ain't
that so? Lookit how long the war was over before he
died.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was awful good to her after they got married.
He took her to a show every night&mdash;jes swell; and
she had given him a swell funeral&mdash;you bet she did.
The coffin had cost eighty-five dollars&mdash;white with
real silver handles; and the floral piece she bought&mdash;&#8220;Gee!
What's your name?... Connie, you oughtta
seen that floral piece!&#8221; and Mame laid off work altogether
to use her hands the better. It was shaped so,
and in the middle was a clock made out of flowers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with the hands at the very minute and hour he'd
died. (He passed away of a headache&mdash;very sudden.)
Then below, in clay, were two clasped hands&mdash;his
and hers. &#8220;Gee! Connie, you never seen nothin' so
swell. Everybody seen it said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once he bought her a white evening dress, low
neck, fish-tail train, pearls all over the front&mdash;cost
him one whole week's salary, eighty-five dollars!
She had diamond earrings and jewels worth at least
one thousand dollars. She had lovely clothes.
Couldn't she just put a black band around the arms
and go on wearing them? She took a look at my earrings.
Gee! they were swell. She had some green
ones herself. Next morning she appeared in her
widow's weeds with bright-green earrings at least a
quarter of an inch longer than mine.</p>

<p>From the first Mame clung to me morning and
night. Usually mornings she threw her arms around
me in the dressing room. &#8220;Here's my Connie!&#8221; I
saw myself forced to labor in the brassworks for life
because of Mame's need of me. This need seemed
more than spiritual. One day her pocketbook with
twelve dollars had been stolen in the Subway. I
lent her some cash. Another time she left her money
at the factory. I lent her the wherewithal to get home
with, etc. One day I was not at work. Somehow the
other girls all were down on Mame. I have pondered
much on that. When it came to the needed collection
Mame found it hard pickings. She got a penny
from this girl, another from that one, until she had
made up a nickel to get home with. Irish Minnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
gave her a sandwich and an apple. The girls all
jumped on me: &#8220;The way you let that Frenchie
work ya! Gee! you believe everything anybody tells
ya.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says I, &#8220;she's been a widow only three
weeks and I'm terrible sorry for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d'ya know she ever had a husband?&#8221;
&#8220;How d'ya know he's dead?&#8221; &#8220;How'd ya....&#8221;</p>

<p>The skepticism of factory workers appals me.
They suspect everybody and everything from the
boss down. I believed almost everything about
Mame, especially since she paid back all she ever
borrowed. No one else in that factory believed a
word she said. They couldn't &#8220;stand her round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How d'ya know she lost her pocketbook?&#8221;
(Later she advertised and got it back&mdash;a doctor's
wife found it on the early Subway.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor's wife,&#8221; sniffed Minnie. &#8220;Who ever heard
of a doctor's wife up at seven o'clock in the mornin'?&#8221;</p>

<p>And now I have walked off and left Mame to that
assemblage of unbelievers. At least Mame has a
tongue of her own she is only too glad of a chance
to use. It is meat and drink to Mame to have a
man look her way. &#8220;Did you see that fella insult
me?&#8221; and she calls back protective remarks for half
a block. Sentiments that usually bring in mention
of the entertained youth's mother and sisters, and
wind up with allusions to a wife, which if he doesn't
possess now, he may some day. Once I stopped
with Mame while she and Irene phoned a &#8220;fella&#8221;
of Irene's from a drug-store telephone booth. Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
gigglings and goings on, especially since the &#8220;fella&#8221;
was unknown to Mame at the time. Outside in the
store a pompous, unromantic man grew more and
more impatient for a turn at that booth. When
Mame stepped out he remarked casually that he
hoped she felt she'd gotten five cents' worth. The
dressing down Mame then and there heaped upon
that startled gentleman! Who was he to insult her?
I grew uneasy and feared a scene, but the pompous
party took hasty refuge in the telephone booth and
closed the door. Mame was very satisfied with the
impression she must have made. &#8220;The fresh old
guy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another time Mame sought me out in the factory,
her eyes blazing. &#8220;Connie, I been insulted, horribly
insulted, and I don't see how I can stay in this
factory! You know that girl Irene? Irene she
says to me, 'Mamie, you plannin' to get married
again?'</p>

<p>&#8220;'I dunno,' I says to her, 'but if I do it'll be to
some single fella.'</p>

<p>&#8220;'Huh!' Irene says to me, 'You won't get no single
fella; you'll have to marry a widower with two or
three children.' Think of her insultin' me like that!
I could 'a' slapped her right in the face!&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked Mame one Saturday what she'd be doing
Sunday. She sighed. &#8220;I'll be spendin' the day at the
cemetery, I expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Monday morning I asked Mame about Sunday.
She'd been to church in the morning (Mame, like
most of the girls at the brassworks, was a Catholic),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a show in the afternoon, cabaret for dinner, had
danced till 1, and played poker until 4 <small>A.M.</small> &#8220;If only
my husband was alive,&#8221; said Mame, &#8220;I'd be the
happiest girl on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>One night Mame's landlady wanted to go out and
play poker. She asked Mame to keep her eye and
ear out for the safety of the house. Every five minutes
Mame thought she heard a burglar or somethin'.
&#8220;Gee! I hardly slept at all; kep' wakin' up all the
time. An' that landlady never got in till six this
mornin'!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Hope she was lucky
after playin' poker that long!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sure was,&#8221; sighed Mame. &#8220;Gee! I jus' wish
ya c'u'd see the swell prize she won!&mdash;the most
beau-teful statue&mdash;stands about three feet high&mdash;of
Our Blessed Lady of the Immaculate Conception.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mame's friendship could become almost embarrassing.
One day she announced she wanted me to
marry one of her brothers-in-law. &#8220;I got two nice
ones and we'll go out some Sunday afternoon and
you can have your pick. One's a piano tuner; the
other's a detective.&#8221; I thought offhand the piano
tuner sounded a bit more domestic. He was swell,
Mame said.</p>

<p>Mame didn't think she'd stay long in the brassworks.
It was all right&mdash;the boss she thought was
sort of stuck on her. Did he have a wife? (The boss,
at least sixty years old.) Also Charlie was making
eyes at her. (Charlie was French; so was Mame.
Charlie knew six words of English. Mame three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
words of French. Charlie was sixteen). No, aside
from matrimony, Mame was going to train in Bellevue
Hospital and earn sixty dollars a week being a children's
nurse. She'd heard if you got on the right side
of a doctor it was easy, and already a doctor was
interested in getting Mame in.</p>

<p>And I've just walked off and left Mame.</p>


<p class="thought">Kicked the foot press 7,149 times by the meter
to-day and expected to die of weariness. Thumped,
thumped, thumped without stopping. As with
candy, I got excited about going on piecework. Asked
Miss Hibber what the rates were for my job&mdash;four
and a half cents for one hundred and fifty. Since
I had to kick twice for every cone top finished, that
would have meant around one dollar fifteen cents for
the day. Vanished the piece-rate enthusiasm. Tillie
seemed the only girl on our floor doing piecework.
Tillie, who &#8220;was born there.&#8221; She was thin and
stoop shouldered, wore spectacles, and did her hair
according to the pompadour styles of some twenty
years ago. The work ain't so bad. Tillie don't mind
it. There's just one thing in the world Tillie wants.
What's that? &#8220;A man!&#8221; Evidently Tillie has made
no bones of her desire. The men call back kindly to
Tillie as she picks her way up the dark stairs in the
morning, &#8220;Hello there, sweetheart!&#8221; That week
had been a pretty good one for Tillie&mdash;she'd made
sixteen dollars forty-nine cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain't much, p'raps, one way, but there's jus'
this about it, it's steady. They never lay anybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
off here, and there's a lot. You hear these girls 'round
here talk about earnin' four, five, six dollars a day.
Mebbe they did, but why ain't they gettin' it now?
'Shop closed down,' or, 'They laid us off.' That's it.
Add it up over a year and my sixteen forty-nine'll
look big as their thirty dollars to forty dollars a week,
see if it don't.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tillie's old, fat, wheezy mother works on our floor&mdash;maybe
Tillie really was born there.</p>

<p>One day I decided to see what could be done if I
went the limit. Suppose I had a sick mother and a
lame brother&mdash;a lot of factory girls have. I was on
a press where you had to kick four separate times on
each piece&mdash;small lamp cones, shaped, slot already
in. My job was to punch four holes for the brackets
to hold the chimney. The day before I had kicked
over 10,000 times. This morning I gritted my teeth
and started in. Between 10 and 11 I had gotten up
to 2,000 kicks an hour. Miss Hibber went by and I
asked her what piece rates for that machine were.
She said six and one-quarter cents for one hundred
and fifty. I did not stop then to do any figuring.
Told her rather chestily I could kick 2,000 times an
hour. &#8220;That all? You ought to do much more than
that!&#8221; Between 11 and 12 I worked as I had never
worked. It was humanly impossible to kick that
machine oftener than I did. Never did I let my eyes
or thoughts wander. When the whistle blew at 12
I had kicked 2,689. For a moment I figured. It
takes about an hour in the morning to get on to the
swing. From 11 to 12 was always my best output.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
After lunch was invariably deadly. From 12.30
until 2.30 it seemed impossible to get up high speed.
That left at best 2.30 to 4 for anything above average
effort. From 4 to 5 it was hard again on account of
physical weariness. But say I could average 2,500
an hour during the day. That would have brought
me in, four kicks to each cone, around two dollars
and a quarter a day. The fact of the matter was
that after kicking 8,500 times that morning I gave
up the ghost as far as that job went. I ached body
and soul. By that time I had been on that one job
several days and was sick to death of it. Each cone
I picked up to punch those four holes in made something
rub along my backbone or in the pit of my
stomach or in my head&mdash;or in all of them at once.
Yet the old woman next me had been at her same job
for over a week. The last place she'd worked she'd
done the identical thing six months&mdash;preferred it to
changing around. Most of the girls took that attitude.
Up to date that is the most amazing thing I
have learned from my factory experiences&mdash;the
difference between my attitude toward a monotonous
job, and the average worker's. In practically every
case the girl has actually preferred the monotonous
job to one with any variety. The muscles in my legs
ached so I could almost have shed tears. The day
before I had finished at 5 tired out. That morning
I had wakened up tired&mdash;the only time in my life.
I could hardly kick at all the first half hour. There
was a gnawing sort of pain between my shoulders.
Suppose I really had been on piecework and had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
keep up at that breaking rate, only to begin the next
morning still more worn out? My Gawd!</p>

<p>Most of the girls kick with the same leg all the time.
I tried changing off now and then. With the four-hole
machine, using the left leg meant sitting a little
to the right side. Also I tried once using my left
hand to give the right a rest. Thus the boss observed
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now see here, m'girl, why don't you do things
the way you're taught? That ain't the right way!&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught me at the wrong moment. I didn't
care whether the earth opened up and swallowed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the right way of runnin' this machine
good as you do,&#8221; I fairly glared at him. &#8220;I'm sick
and tired of doin' it the right way, and if I want to
do it wrong awhile for a change I guess I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain't goin' to get ahead in this world if you
don't do things <i>right</i>, m'girl.&#8221; And he left me to my
fate.</p>

<p>At noon that day the girls got after me. &#8220;You're
a fool to work the way you do. You never took a
drink all this mornin'&mdash;jus' sit there kickin', kickin',
kickin'. Where d'ya think ya goin' to land? In a
coffin, that's where. The boss won't thank ya for
killin' yourself on his old foot press, neither. You're
jus' a fool, workin' like that.&#8221; And that's just what
I decided. &#8220;Lay off now and then.&#8221; Yes indeed, I
was going to lay off now and then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see myself breakin' my neck for thirteen dollars
a week,&#8221; Bella chipped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; from all the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>So I kicked over 16,000 times that day and let
it go as my final swan song. No more breaking
records for me. My head thumped, thumped,
thumped all that night. After that I strolled up
front for a drink and a gossip or back to a corner
of the wash room where two or three were sure to be
squatting on some old stairs, fussing over the universe.
When the boss was up on the other end of the
floor, sometimes I just sat at my machine and did
nothing. It hurt something within my soul at first,
but my head and hands and legs and feet and neck
and general disposition felt considerably better.</p>

<p>Lunch times suited me exactly at the brassworks,
making me feel I was getting what I was after.
Three of us used to gather around Irish Minnie, put
two stools lengthwise on the floor, and squat along
the sides. Bella, who'd worked in Detroit for seven
dollars a day (her figures), a husky good-looking
person; Rosie, the prettiest little sixteen-year-old
Italian girl; and I. Such conversations! One day
they unearthed Harry Thaw and Evelyn Nesbit and
redid their past, present, and probable future. We
discussed whether Olive Thomas had really committed
suicide or died of an overdose of something.
How many nights a week could a girl dance and
work next day? Minnie was past her dancing days.
She'd been married 'most twenty years and was
getting fat and unformed-looking; shuffled about in
a pair of old white tennis shoes and a pink boudoir
cap. (No one else wore a cap at the brassworks.)
Minnie had worked fifteen years at a power press,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
eleven years at her last job. She was getting the
generous stipend of fourteen dollars a week (one
dollar more than the rest of us). She had earned as
much as twenty-five dollars a week in her old job
at the tin can company, piecework. Everybody
about the factory told her troubles to Minnie, who
immediately told them to everybody else. It made
for a certain community interest. One morning
Minnie would tell me, as I passed her machine,
&#8220;Rosie 'n' Frank have had a fight.&#8221; With that cue
it was easy to appear intelligent concerning future
developments. Frank was one of the machinists, an
Italian. Rosie had let him make certain advances&mdash;put
his arm around her and all that&mdash;but she told us
one lunch time, &#8220;he'd taken advantage of her,&#8221; so
she just sassed him back now. Bella announced
Frank was honeying around her. &#8220;Well, watch
out,&#8221; Rosie advised, with the air of Bella's greataunt.</p>

<p>As to dancing, Bella's chum in Detroit used to go
to a dance every single night and work all day.
Sundays she'd go to a show and a dance. Bella tried
it one week and had to lay off three days of the next
week before she could get back to work. Lost her
twenty-one dollars. No more of that for Bella. Just
once in a while was enough for her.</p>

<p>They did not talk about &#8220;vamping dopes&#8221; at the
brassworks. Everyone asked you if you were &#8220;keepin'
company,&#8221; and talked of fellas and sweethearts
and intended husbands. That was the scale. As
before, all the married ones invariably advised
against matrimony. Irish Minnie told us one lunch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
time that it was a bad job, this marrying business.
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she admitted, pulling on a piece of
roast pork with her teeth, &#8220;my husband ain't what
you'd call a <i>bad</i> man.&#8221; That was as far as Minnie
cared to go.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason why the brassworks employed
so many crooked and decrepit was as an efficiency
measure. The few males who were whole caused so
many flutterings among the female hands that it
seriously interfered with production. Rosie's real
cause for turning Frank down was that she was
after Good Lookin'. Good Lookin' would not have
been so good lookin' out along the avenue, but in
the setting of our third floor he was an Adonis.
Rosie worked a power press. I would miss the clank
of her machine. There she would be up in the corner
of the floor where Good Lookin' worked. Good
Lookin' would go for a drink. Rosie would get
thirsty that identical moment. They would carry
on an animated conversation, to be rudely broken
into by a sight of the boss meandering up their way.
Rosie would make a dash for her machine, Good
Lookin' would saunter over to his.</p>


<p class="thought">From the start I had pestered the boss to be allowed
on a power press, for two reasons: one just
because I wanted to&mdash;the same reason why a small
boy wants to work at machinery; secondly, I wanted
to be able to pose at the next job as an experienced
power-press worker and sooner or later get a high-power
machine. One day the boss was watching me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
at the foot press. &#8220;Y'know, m'girl, I think you
really got intelligence, blessed if I don't. I'm goin'
to push you right ahead. I'll make a machinist out
of you yet, see if I don't. You stay right on here
and you'll be making big money yet.&#8221; (Minnie&mdash;eleven
years in her last job&mdash;fourteen dollars a week
now.) Anyway, one morning he came up&mdash;and that
morning foot presses of every description had lost
all fascination for me&mdash;and he said, &#8220;You still want
a power press?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet your life I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>And he gave me a power press deserted that morning
by one of the boys. Life looked worth living
again. All I had to do to work miracles was press
ever so lightly a pedal. The main point was to get
my foot off it as quick as I got it on, or there was
trouble. I wasn't to get my fingers here or there, or
&#8220;I'd never play the piano in this life.&#8221; If the belt
flew off I wasn't to grab it, or I'd land up at the
ceiling. For the rest, I merely clamped a round piece
on the top of a nail-like narrow straight piece&mdash;the
part that turned the lamp wick up and down. Hundreds
and thousands of them I made. The monotony
did not wear on me there; it was mixed with
no physical exertion. I could have stayed on at the
brassworks the rest of my life&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p>One night I was waiting at a cold, windy corner on
Fifth Avenue for a bus. None came. A green
Packard limousine whirled by. The chauffeur waved
and pointed up the Avenue. In a flash I thought,
now if I really were a factory girl I'd surely jump at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a chance to ride in that green Packard. Up half a
block I ran, and climbed in the front seat, as was
expected of me. He was a very nice chauffeur.
His mistress, &#8220;the old lady,&#8221; was at a party and he
was killing time till 11.30. Would I like to ride till
then? No, I wanted to get home&mdash;had to be up too
early for joy riding. Why so early? The factory.
And before I realized it there I sat, the factory girl.
Immediately he asked me to dinner any night I said.
Now I really thought it would be worth doing; no
one else I knew had been out to dine with a chauffeur.
Where would he take me? What would he talk
about? But my nerve failed me. No, I didn't think
I'd go. I fussed about for some excuse. I was sort
of new in New York&mdash;out West, it was different.
There you could pick up with anybody, go any place.
&#8220;Good Gawd! girl,&#8221; said the chauffeur, earnestly,
&#8220;don't try that in New York; you'll get in awful
trouble!&#8221; All through Central Park he gave me
advice about New York and the pitfalls it contained
for a Westerner. He'd be very careful about me if
I'd go out with him, any place I said, and he'd get
me home early as I said. But I didn't say. I'd have
to think it over. He could telephone to me. No, he
couldn't. The lady I lived with was very particular.
Well, anyhow, stormy days he'd see to it he'd be
down by the factory and bring me home. Would I
be dressed just the way I was then? Just the way&mdash;green
tam and all.</p>

<p>The next day while I thumped out lamp parts I
tried to screw my courage up to go out with that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
chauffeur. Finally I decided to put it up to the
girls. I meandered back to the wash room. There on
the old stairs sat Irish Minnie and Annie, fat and
ultradignified. They were discussing who the father
of the child really was. I breezed in casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vamped a chauffeur last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go-an.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. He asked me to ride home with him an' I
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got in the machine with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>fool</i>! You young <i>fool</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Goodness! I was unprepared for such comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do to ya?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin'. An' he wants me to go to dinner with
him. What'll I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both pondered. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Minnie, &#8220;I b'lieve
in a girl gettin' all that's comin' to her, but all I want
to tell ya is, chauffeurs are a bad lot&mdash;the worst, I
tell ya.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; nodded fat Annie, as if years of
harrowing experience lay behind her. &#8220;He was all
right to ya the first time so as to lure you out the
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; says Minnie, &#8220;if ya go to dinner with him,
don't you go near his machine. Steer clear of machines.
Eat all ya can off him, but don't do no
ridin'.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; again Annie backed her up. Annie
was a regular sack slinger. She could have hurled
two men off Brooklyn Bridge with one hand. &#8220;If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you was as big an' strong as me you c'u'd take 'most
any chance. I'd like to see a guy try to pull anythin'
on me.&#8221; I'd like to see him, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day&#8221;&mdash;Minnie wanted to drive her advice
home by concrete illustration&mdash;&#8220;some day a chauffeur'll
hold a handkerchief under your nose with
somethin' on it. When ya come to, goodness knows
where you'll be.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to feel a little as if I'd posed as too innocent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, out West&mdash;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd!&#8221;&mdash;Minnie waved a hand scornfully&mdash;&#8220;don't
be tryin' to tell me all men are angels out
West.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Miss Hibber poked her head in and we
suddenly took ourselves out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go easy, now,&#8221; Minnie whispered after me.</p>

<p>I lacked the nerve, anyhow, and they put on the
finishing touches. A bricklayer would not have been
so bad. How did I know the chauffeur was not
working for a friend of mine? That, later on, would
make it more embarrassing for him than me. I
should think he would want to wring my neck.</p>

<p>It was about time to find a new job, anyhow. But
leaving the brassworks is like stopping a novel in the
middle. What about Rosie and good looking
Bella and her brother she was trying to rescue from
the grip of the poolroom? Mame&mdash;Mame and her
kaleidoscope romances, insults, and adventures? I
just hate walking off and leaving it all. And the
boss and Miss Hibber so nice to me about everything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Before a week is gone Minnie will be telling in an
awed voice that she knows what happened. She told
me not to go out with that chauffeur. I went, anyhow,
and they found my mangled body in the gutter
in Yonkers.</p>

<h4><i>195 Irons &#8220;Family&#8221;</i></h4>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow</span> long, I wonder, does one study or work at
anything before one feels justified in generalizing?</p>

<p>I have been re-reading of late some of the writings
of some of the women who at one time or another
essayed to experience first hand the life of the working
girl. They have a bit dismayed me. Is it exactly
fair, what they do? They thought, because they
changed their names and wore cheap clothes, that,
presto! they were as workers and could pass on to an
uninformed reading public the trials of the worker.
(Incidentally they were all trials.) I had read in the
past those heartrending books and articles and found
it ever difficult to hold back the tears. Sometimes
they were written by an immigrant, a bona-fide
worker. The tragedy of such a life in this business-ridden
land of ours tore one's soul.</p>

<p>An educated, cultured individual, used to a life
of ease, or easier, if she had wished to make it that,
would find the life of the factory worker well-nigh
unbearable. An emotional girl longing for the higher
things of life would find factory life galling beyond
words. It is to be regretted that there are not more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
educated and cultured people&mdash;that more folk do not
long for the higher things of life&mdash;that factory work
is not galling to everybody. But the fact seems to
be, if we dare generalize, that there are a very great
many persons in this world who are neither educated
nor &#8220;cultured&#8221; nor filled with spiritual longings.
The observation might be made that all such are not
confined to the working classes; that the country at
large, from Fifth Avenue, New York, to Main Street,
Gopher Prairie, to Market Street, San Francisco,
is considerably made up of folk who are not educated
or &#8220;cultured&#8221; or of necessity filled with unsatiable
longings of the soul.</p>

<p>It is partly due to the fact that only recently&mdash;as
geologic time is reckoned&mdash;we were swinging in
trees, yearning probably for little else than a nut to
crack, a mate, a shelter of sorts, something of ape
company, and now and then a chance for a bit of a
scrap. It is partly due to the fact that for the great
majority of people, the life they live from the cradle
up is not the sort that matures them with a growing
ambition or opportunity to experience the &#8220;finer&#8221;
things of life. One point of view would allow that the
reason we have so few educated, cultured, and aspiring
people is due to a combination of unfortunate
circumstances to do with heredity and environment.
They would be cultured and spiritual if only....</p>

<p>The other viewpoint argues that the only reason
we have as many cultured and spiritual people as
we have is due to a fortunate&mdash;&#8220;lucky&#8221;&mdash;combination
of circumstances to do with heredity and environment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
These more advanced folk would be far fewer
in number if it had not happened that....</p>

<p>It is mostly the &#8220;educated and cultured&#8221; persons
who write the more serious books we read and who
tell us what they and the rest of the world think
and feel and do&mdash;or ought to do. The rest of the
world never read what they ought to think and
feel and do, and go blithely&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;on their
way thinking and feeling and doing&mdash;what they
please, or as circumstances force them.</p>

<p>After all, the world is a very subjective thing, and
what makes life worth living to one person is not
necessarily what makes it worth living to another.
Certain fundamental things everybody is apt to want:
enough to eat (but what a gamut that &#8220;enough&#8221; can
run!); a mate (the range and variety of mates who
do seem amply to satisfy one another!); a shelter
to retire to nights (what a bore if we all had to live
complacently on the Avenue!); children to love and
fuss over&mdash;but one child does some parents and ten
children do others, and some mothers go into a decline
if everything is not sterilized twice a day and
everybody clean behind the ears, and other mothers
get just as much satisfaction out of their young when
there is only one toothbrush, if that, for everybody
(we are writing from the mother's viewpoint and not
the welfare of the offspring); some possessions of
one's own, but not all stocks and bonds and a box of
jewels in the bank, or a library, or an automobile,
or even a house and lot, before peace reigns.</p>

<p>Everyone likes to mingle with his kind now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
then; to some it is subjectively necessary to hire a
caterer, to others peanuts suffice. Everyone likes to
wonder and ponder and express opinions&mdash;a prize
fight is sufficient material for some; others prefer
metaphysics. Everyone likes to play. Some need
box seats at the Midnight Frolic, others a set of
second-hand tools, and yet others a game of craps in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>No one likes to be hungry, to be weary, to be sick,
to be worried over the future, to be lonely, to have his
feelings hurt, to lose those near and dear to him, to
have too little independence, to get licked in a scrap
of any kind, to have no one at all who loves him, to
have nothing at all to do. The people of the so-called
working class are more apt to be hungry,
weary, and sick than the &#8220;educated and cultured&#8221;
and well-to-do. Otherwise there is no one to say&mdash;because
there is no way it can be found out&mdash;that
their lives by and large are not so rich, subjectively
speaking, as those with one hundred thousand dollars
a year, or with Ph. D. degrees.</p>

<p>Most folk in the world are not riotously happy, not
because they are poor, or &#8220;workers,&#8221; but because
the combination making for riotous happiness&mdash;shall
we say health, love, enough to do of what one longs
to do&mdash;is not often found in one individual. The
condition of the bedding, of the clothing; the pictures
on the wall; the smells in the kitchen&mdash;and beyond;
the food on the table&mdash;have so much, and no more, to
do with it. Whether one sorts soiled clothes in a
laundry, or reclines on a chaise-longue with thirty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
small hand-embroidered and belaced pillows
and a pink satin covering, or sits in a library and
fusses over Adam Smith, no one of the three is in a
position to pass judgment on the satisfaction or lack
of satisfaction of the other two.</p>

<p>All of which is something of an impatient retort to
those who look at the world through their own eyes
and by no means a justification of the <i>status quo</i>.
And to introduce the statement&mdash;which a month ago
would have seemed to me incredible&mdash;that I have
seen and heard as much contentment in a laundry
as I have in the drawing-room of a Fifth Avenue
mansion or a college sorority house&mdash;as much and
no more. Which is not arguing that no improvements
need ever be made in laundries.</p>


<p class="thought">There was one place I was not going to work, and
that was a laundry! I had been through laundries,
I had read about laundries, and it was too much to
ask anyone&mdash;if it was not absolutely necessary&mdash;to
work in a laundry. And yet when the time came, I
hated to leave the laundry. I entered the laundry as
a martyr. I left with the nickname, honestly come
by without a Christian effort, of &#8220;Sunbeam.&#8221; But,
oh! I have a large disgust upon me that it takes
such untold effort every working day, all over the
&#8220;civilized,&#8221; world to keep people &#8220;civilized.&#8221; The
labor, and labor, and labor of first getting cloth
woven and buttons and thread manufactured and
patterns cut and garments made up, and fitted, or
not, and then to keep those garments <i>clean</i>! We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
talk with such superiority of the fact that we wear
clothes and heathen savages get along with beads
and rushes. For just that some six hundred and fifty
thousand people work six days a week doing laundry
work alone&mdash;not to mention mother at the home
washboard&mdash;or electric machine. We must be clean,
of course, or we would not be civilized, but I do not
see why we need be so fearfully sot up about it.</p>

<p>A new Monday morning came along, and I waited
from 7.40 to 9.15 in a six-by-nine entry room, with
some twenty-five men and women, to answer the
advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">GIRLS, OVER 18</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">with public school education, to learn machine ironing, marking,
and assorting linens; no experience necessary; splendid
opportunity for right parties; steady positions; hours 8 to
5.30; half day Saturday.</p></div>

<p>What the idea was of advertising for superior education
never became clear. No one was asked how
far she had progressed intellectually. I venture to
say the majority of girls there had had no more than
the rudiments of the three r's. It looked well in
print. One of the girls from the brassworks stood
first in line. She had tried two jobs since I saw her
last. She did not try the laundry at all.</p>

<p>I was third in line. The manager himself interviewed
us inside, since the &#8220;Welfare Worker&#8221; was
ill. What experience had I? I was experienced in
both foot and power presses. He phoned to the
&#8220;family&#8221; floor&mdash;two vacancies. I was signed up as
press ironer, family. I wouldn't find it so hard as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
brassworks&mdash;in fact, it really wasn't hard at all. He
would start me in at fourteen dollars a week, since I
was experienced, instead of the usual twelve. At the
end of two weeks, if I wasn't earning more than
fourteen dollars&mdash;it was a piecework system, with
fourteen dollars as a minimum&mdash;I'd have to go, and
make room for some one who could earn more than
fourteen dollars.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Welfare Worker would have made
the same speech. That manager was a fraud. On
our floor, at least, no one had ever been known to
earn more than her weekly minimum. He was a
smart fraud. Only I asked too many questions upstairs,
he would have had me working like a slave to
hold my job.</p>

<p>By the time clock, where I was told to wait, stood
the woman just ahead of me in the line. She was the
first really bitter soul I had run across in factory
work. Her husband had been let out of his job,
along with all workers in his plant, without notice.
After January 1st they might reopen, but at 1914
wages. There was one child in the family. The
father had hunted everywhere for work. For one
week the mother had searched. She had tried a
shoe polish factory; they put her on gluing labels.
The smell of the glue made her terribly sick to her
stomach&mdash;for three days she was forced to stay in
bed. Three times she had tried this laundry. Each
day, after keeping her waiting in line an hour or so,
they had told her to come back the next day. At
last she had gotten as far as the time clock. I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
her several times in the evening line after that; she
was doing &#8220;pretty well&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;shaking&#8221; on the third
floor. Her arms nearly dropped off by evening, but
she sure was glad of the thirteen dollars a week. Her
husband had found nothing.</p>

<p>The third to join our time-clock ranks was a
Porto-Rican. She could speak no English at all.
They put her at scrubbing floors for twelve dollars a
week. About 4 that afternoon she appeared on our
floor, all agitated. She needed a Spanish girl there to
tell the boss she was leaving. She was one exercised
piece of temper when it finally penetrated just what
her job was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Family&#8221; occupied two-thirds of the sixth and
top floor&mdash;the other third was the &#8220;lunch room.&#8221;
Five flights to walk up every morning. But at least
there was the lunch room without a step up at noon.
And it was worth climbing five flights to have Miss
Cross for a forelady. Sooner or later I must run into
a disagreeable forelady, for the experience. To hear
folks talk, plenty of that kind exist. Miss Cross was
glad I was to be on her floor. She told the manager
and me she'd noticed me that morning in line and
just thought I'd made a good press ironer. Was I
Eyetalian?</p>

<p>She gave me the second press from the door, right
in front of a window, and a window open at the top.
That was joy for me, but let no one think the average
factory girl consciously pines for fresh air. Miss
Cross ironed the lowers of a pair of pajamas to show
me how it was done, then the coat part. While she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was instructing me in such intricacies, she was deftly
finding out all she could about my past, present, and
future&mdash;married or single, age, religion, and so on.
And I watched, fascinated, crumpled pajama legs,
with one mighty press of the foot, appear as perfect
and flawless as on the Christmas morning they were
first removed from the holly-decorated box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the coat part of a pair of pink pajamas,
smoothed one arm a bit by hand as I laid it out on
the stationary side of the ironing press, shaped somewhat
like a large metal sleeve board. With both
hands I gripped the wooden bar on the upper part,
all metal but the bar. With one foot I put most of
my weight on the large pedal. That locked the hot
metal part on the padded, heated, lower half with a
bang. A press on the release pedal, the top flew up&mdash;too
jarringly, if you did not keep hold of the bar
with one hand. That ironed one side of one sleeve.
Turn the other side, press, release. Do the other
sleeve on two sides. Do the shoulders all around&mdash;about
four presses and releases to that. Another
to one side of the front&mdash;two if it is for a big fat man.
One under the arm, two or three to the back, one
under the other arm, one or two to the other half
of the front, one, two, or three to the collar, depending
on the style. About sixteen clanks pressing down,
sixteen releases flying up, to one gentleman's pajama
coat. I had the hang of it, and was left alone. Then
I combined ironing and seeing what was what. If a
garment was very damp&mdash;and most of them were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&mdash;the
press had to be locked several seconds before
being released, to dry it out. During those seconds
one's eyes were free to wander.</p>

<p>On my left, next the door, worked a colored girl
with shell-rimmed spectacles, very friendly, whose
name was Irma. Of Irma later. On my right was
the most woebegone-looking soul, an Italian widow,
Lucia, in deep mourning&mdash;husband dead five weeks,
with two daughters to support. She could not speak
a word of English, and in this country sixteen years.
All this I had from the forelady in between her finding
out everything there was to know about me. Bless
my soul, if Lucia did not perk up the second the forelady
left, edge over, and direct a volume of Italian at
me. What won't green earrings do! Old Mrs. Reilly
called out, &#8220;Ach, the poor soul's found a body to
talk to at last!&#8221; But, alas! Lucia's hope was short
lived. &#8220;What!&#8221; called Mrs. Reilly, &#8220;you ain't
Eyetalian? Well, you ought to be, now, because you
look it, and because there ought to be somebody
here for Lucy to talk to!&#8221; Lucia was diseased-looking
and unkempt-looking and she ironed very
badly. Everyone tried to help her out. They instructed
her with a flow of English. When Lucia
would but shake her head they used the same flow,
only much louder, several at once. Then Lucia
would mumble to herself for several minutes over her
ironing. At times, late in the afternoon, Miss Cross
would grow discouraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you understand that when you iron a shirt
you put the sleeves over the puffer <i>first</i>?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucia would shake her head and shrug her shoulders
helplessly. Miss Cross would repeat with
vehemence. Then one girl would poke Lucia and
point to the puffer&mdash;&#8220;Puffer! puffer!&#8221; Another
would hold up a shirt and holler &#8220;Shirt! shirt!&#8221; and
Lucia would nod vaguely. The next shirt she did
as all the others&mdash;puffer last, which mussed the
ironed part&mdash;until some one stopped her work and
did a whole shirt for Lucia correct, from beginning
to end.</p>

<p>Next to Lucia stood Fanny, colored. She was a
good-hearted, helpful, young married thing, not over-cleanly
and not overstrong. That first morning she
kept her eye on me and came to my rescue on a new
article of apparel every so often. Next to Fanny
stood the three puffers for anyone to use&mdash;oval-shaped,
hot metal forms, for all gathers, whether in
sleeves, waists, skirts, or what not. Each girl had a
large egg-shaped puffer on her own table as well.
Next to the puffers stood the two sewing machines,
where Spanish Sarah and colored Hattie darned and
mended.</p>

<p>At the side, behind the machines, stood Ida at her
press. All the presses were exactly alike. Ida was a
joy to my eyes. At first glance she appeared just a
colored girl, but Ida was from Trinidad; her skin
was like velvet, her accent Spanish. As the room
grew hot from the presses and the steam, along about
4, and our feet began to burn and grow weary, I
would look at Ida. It was so easy to picture the
exact likes of her, not more than a generation or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ago, squatting under a palm tree with a necklace of
teeth, a ring through her nose, tropic breezes playing
on that velvet skin. (Please, I know naught of
Trinidad or its customs and am only guessing.) And
here stood Ida, thumping, thumping on the ironing
press, nine hours, lacking ten minutes, a day, on the
sixth floor of a laundry in Harlem, that we in Manhattan
might be more civilized.</p>

<p>Once she told me she had lost fifteen pounds in
this country. &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, child,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it's tha mother sickness.
Don't you ever know it? Back home in Trinidad are
my mother, my father, my two little boys. Oh, tha
sickness to see them! But what is one to do when
you marry a poor man? He must come to this
country to find work, and then, after a while, I must
come, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind Ida stood two other colored girls, and at
the end press a white girl who started the day after
I did. She stayed only five days, and left in disgust&mdash;told
me she'd never seen such hard work. Beyond
the last press were the curtain frames and the large,
round padded table for ironing fancy table linen by
hand. Then began the lunch tables.</p>

<p>Behind the row of presses by the windows stood
the hand ironers who did the fancy work. First came
Ella, neat, old, gray-haired, fearfully thin, wrinkled,
with a dab of red rouge on each cheek. After all,
one really cannot be old if one dabs on rouge before
coming to work all day in a laundry. Ella had hand
ironed all her life. She had been ten years in her last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
job, but the place changed hands. She liked ironing,
she said. Ella never talked to anybody, even at
lunch time.</p>

<p>Behind Ella ironed Anna Golden, black, who wore
striped silk stockings. She always had a bad cold.
Most of the girls had colds most of the time&mdash;from
the steam, they said. Anna had spent two dollars
on medicine that week, which left her fourteen dollars.
Anna was the one person to use an electric
iron. It had newly been installed. The others
heated their irons over gas flames. Every so often
Miss Cross would call out, &#8220;I smell gas!&#8221; So did
everybody else. After Anna, Lucile, blackest of all
and a widow. And then&mdash;Mrs. Reilly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reilly and Hattie were the characters of the
sixth floor. Mrs. Reilly was old and fat and Irish.
She had stood up hand ironing so long the part of
her from the waist up seemed to have settled down
into her hips. Eleven years had Mrs. Reilly ironed
in our laundry. She was the one pieceworker in the
building. In summer she could make from twenty
to twenty-five dollars a week, but she claimed she
lost a great part of it in winter. She said she was
anxious to get on timework. One afternoon I saw
Mrs. Reilly iron just two things&mdash;the rest of the
while, nothing to do, she sat on an old stool with her
eyes closed.</p>

<p>The first afternoon, Mrs. Reilly edged over to me
on pretext of ironing out a bit of something on my
press.</p>

<p>&#8220;An' how are you makin' out?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, only my feet are awful tired. Don't
your feet never get tired?</p>

<p>&#8221;Shure, child, an' what good would it do for my
feet to get tired when they're all I got to stand on?
An' did you ever try settin' nine hours a day? Shure
an' that would be the death of anybody.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reilly's indoor sport was marrying the sixth
floor off. Poor Lucia's widow's weeds of five weeks
were no obstacle to Mrs. Reilly. She frequently
made the whole floor giggle, carrying on an animated
Irish conversation with Lucia over the prospects of
a second marriage&mdash;or rather, a monologue it was,
since Lucia never knew she was being talked to. If
ever there was a body with a &#8221;sex complex it was
old Mrs. Reilly! When I asked her once why she
didn't get busy marrying off herself, she called back:
&#8220;The Lord be praised! And didn't I get more than
enough of the one man I had?&#8221;</p>

<p>At least twice a week Mrs. Reilly saw a ghost, and
she would tell us about it in the morning. She
laughed then, and we all laughed, but you could
easily picture the poor old fearful soul meeting that
inevitable 2 <small>A.M.</small> guest, quaking over it in her lonely
bed. Once the ghost was extra terrifying. &#8220;It may
have been the banama sauce,&#8221; admitted Mrs.
Reilly. And Mrs. Reilly's feet did hurt often. She
used sometimes to take off her worn shoes and try
tying her feet up in cardboards.</p>

<p>The other workers on our floor were Mabel and
Mary, two colored girls who finished off slight rough
edges in the press ironing and folded everything;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Edna, a Cuban girl who did handkerchiefs on the
mangle; Annie, the English girl, lately married to an
American. She had an inclosure of shelves to work
in and there she did the final sorting and wrapping of
family wash. Annie was the most superior person
on our floor.</p>

<p>And Miss Cross. In face, form, neatness, and
manners Miss Cross could have held her own socially
anywhere. But according to orthodox standards
Miss Cross's grammar was faulty. She had worked
always in our laundry, beginning as a hand ironer.
She knew the days when hours were longer than nine
and pay lower than fourteen dollars a week. She remembered
when the family floor had to iron Saturdays
until 10 and 11 at night, instead of getting off
at 12.45, as we did now. They stood it in those days;
but how? As it was now, not a girl on our floor but
whose feet ached more or less by 4 or 4.30. Ordinarily
we stopped at 5.30. Everyone knew how everyone
else felt that last half hour. During a week with
any holiday the girls had to work till 6.15 every
night, and Saturday afternoon. They all said&mdash;we
discussed it early one morning&mdash;that in such weeks
they could iron scarcely anything that last hour, their
feet burned so.</p>

<p>The candy factory was hard&mdash;one stood nine hours,
but the work was very light.</p>

<p>The brassworks was hard&mdash;one sat, but the foot
exercise was wearying and the seat fearfully uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Ironing was hardest&mdash;one stood all day and used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the feet for hard pressure besides. Yet I was sorry
to leave the laundry!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well for me that Lucia
could not talk English. She might have used it on
me, and already the left ear was talked off by Irma.
Miss Cross stood for just so much conversation,
according to her mood. Even if she were feeling very
spry, our sixth-floor talk could become only so general
and lively before Miss Cross would call: &#8220;Girls!
girls! not so much noise!&#8221; If it were late in the
afternoon that would quiet us for the day&mdash;no one
had enough energy to start up again.</p>

<p>The first half hour Irma confided in me that she
had cravings. &#8220;Cravings? Cravings for what?&#8221; I
asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cravings for papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>It sounded a trifle goatlike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papers. I want to read papers on the lecture
platform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat I heard all Irma's spiritual longings&mdash;cravings.
She began in school to do papers. That was
two years ago. Since then she has often been asked
to read the papers she wrote in school before church
audiences. Just last Sunday she read one at her
church in New York, and four people asked her
afterward for copies.</p>

<p>What was it about?</p>

<p>It was about the True Woman. When she wrote
it, she began, &#8220;Dear Teacher, Pupils, and Friends.&#8221;
But when she read it in churches she skipped the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Teacher and Pupils and began: &#8220;Dear Friends, ...
now we are met together on this memorable occasion
to consider the subject of the True Woman. First
we must ask&#8221; (here Irma bangs down on a helpless
nightshirt and dries it out well beyond its time into
a nice bunch of wrinkles) &#8220;What is woman? Woman
was created by God because Dear Friends God saw
how lonely man was and how lonesome and so out
of man's ribs God created woman to be man's company
and helpmate....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irma!&#8221; Miss Cross's voice had an oft-repeated
tone to it. She called out from the table where she
checked over each girl's work without so much as
turning her head. &#8220;You ironed only one leg of these
pajamas!&#8221;</p>

<p>Irma shuffled over on her crooked high heels and
returned with the half-done pajamas. &#8220;That fo'-lady!&#8221;
sighed Irma, &#8220;she sure gets on ma nerves.
She's always hollerin' at me 'bout somethin'. She
never hollers at the other girls that way&mdash;she just
picks on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Irma continued with the True Woman:
&#8220;There's another thing the True Woman should
have and that's a good character....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Irma!&#8221; (slight impatience in Miss Cross's tone)
&#8220;you ironed this nightgown on the wrong side!&#8221;</p>

<p>Irma looked appealingly at me. &#8220;There she goes
again. She makes me downright nervous, that fo'-lady
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor, persecuted Irma!</p>

<p>During that first morning Irma had to iron over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at least six things. Then they looked like distraction.
I thought of the manager's introductory speech to
me&mdash;how after two weeks I might have to make way
for a more efficient person.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long you been here?&#8221; I asked Irma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you makin'?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever get extra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suspicions concerning the manager.</p>

<p>Irma had three other papers. One was on Testing
Time. What was Testing Time? It might concern
chemical tubes. It might be a bit of romance. And
she really meant Trysting Time. No, to everybody
a time comes when he or she must make a great
decision. It was about that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Irma! you've got your foot in the middle of that
white apron!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another paper was on Etee-quette (q pronounced).</p>

<p>&#8220;Irma! you creased one of these pajama legs down
the middle! Do it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pondered much during my laundry days as to
why they kept Irma. She told me she first worked
down on the shirt-and-collar floor and used to do
&#8220;one hundred and ten shirts an hour,&#8221; but the boss
got down on her. It took her sometimes three-quarters
of an hour to do one boy's shirt on our floor,
and then one half the time she had it to do over.
Her ironing was beyond all words fearful to behold
(there must be an Irma in every laundry). She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
all-mannered slow. She forgot to tag her work. She
hung it over her horse so that cuffs and apron strings
were always on the floor. Often she was late. Sometimes
Miss Cross would grow desperate&mdash;but there
Irma remained. Below, in that little entryway,
were girls waiting for jobs. Did they figure that on
the whole Irma wrecked fewer garments than the
average new girl, or what? And the manager had
tried to scare me!</p>

<p>The noon bell rings&mdash;we dash for the lunch-room
line. You can purchase pies and soup and fruit,
hash and stew, coffee and tea, cafeteria style. There
are only two women to serve&mdash;the girls from the
lower floors have to stand long in line. I do not know
where to sit, and by mistake evidently get at a wrong
table. No one talks to me. I surely feel I am not
where I belong. The next day I get at another wrong
table. It is so very evident I am not wanted where I
am. Rather disconcerting. I sit and ponder. I
had thought factory girls so much more friendly to
one another on short acquaintance than &#8220;cultured&#8221;
people. But it is merely that they are more natural.
When they feel friendly they show it with no reserves.
When they do not feel friendly they show that without
reserve. Which is where the unnaturalness of
&#8220;cultured&#8221; folk sometimes helps.</p>

<p>It seems etee-quette at the laundry requires each
girl sit at the table where her floor sits. That second
day I was at the shirt-and-collar table, and they, I
was afterward told, are particularly exclusive. Indeed
they are.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>At 12.45 the second bell rings. Miss Cross calls
out, &#8220;All right, girls!&#8221; Clank, the presses begin
again, and all afternoon I iron gentlemen's underpinnings.
During the course of my days in the laundry
I iron three sets round for every man in New
York and thereby acquire a domestic attitude toward
the entire male sex in the radius sending wash to our
laundry. Nobody loves a fat man. But their underclothes
do fit more easily over the press.</p>

<p>I iron and I iron and I iron, and along about 4.30
the first afternoon it occurs to my cynical soul to
wonder what the women are doing with themselves
with the spare time which is theirs, because I am
thumping that press down eight hours and fifty
minutes a day. Not that it is any of my business.</p>

<p>Also along about five o'clock it irritates me to have
to bother with what seems to me futile work. I am
perfectly willing to take great pains with a white
waistcoat&mdash;in one day I learn to make a work of art
of that. But why need one fuss over the back of a
nightshirt? Will a man sleep any better for a wrinkle
more or less? Besides, so soon it is all wrinkles.</p>

<p>The second day I iron soft work all morning&mdash;forever
men's underclothes, pajamas, and nightshirts.
Later, when I am promoted to starched work, I tend
to grow antifeminist. Why can men live and move
and have their beings satisfactorily incased in soft
garments, easy to iron, comfortable to wear, and
why must women have everything starched and
trying on the soul to do up? One minute you iron a
soft nightshirt; the next a nightgown starched like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
board, and the worst thing to get through with
before it dries too much that ever appears in a
laundry.</p>

<p>After lunch I am promoted to hospital work. All
afternoon I iron doctors' and interns' white coats and
trousers. It is more interesting doing that. But a
bit hard on the soul. For it makes you think of sickness
and suffering. Yet sickness and suffering white-coated
men relieve. It makes you think, too, of
having babies&mdash;that being all you know of hospitals
personally. But on such an occasion you never
noticed if the doctor had on a white coat or not, and
surely spent no time pondering over who ironed it.
Yet if a doctor wore a coat Irma ironed I think the
woman would note it even in the last anguished moments
of labor.</p>

<p>Irma did an officer's summer uniform once. I do
wish I could have heard him when he undid the
package. While Irma was pounding down on it
she was discoursing to me how, besides papers, she
had cravings for poetry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember that last snowstorm? I sat at my
window and I wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, beautiful snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When will you go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not until spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the birds sing.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were several other stanzas. And about then
Miss Cross dumped a bundle of damp clothes into
Irma's box and said, &#8220;Iron these next and do them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
decent!&#8221; I peered suspiciously into the box. It was
my own family laundry!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Irma,&#8221; I said, cannily, &#8220;leave me do this
batch, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>I might as well be paying myself for doing up my
own wash, and it would look considerably better
than if Irma ironed it.</p>

<p>The third day my feet are not so weary, and while
I iron I mull over ideas on women in industry. After
all, have not some of us with the good of labor at
heart been a bit too theoretical? Take the welfare
idea so scoffed at by many. After all, there is more
to be said for than against. Of course, provided&mdash;It
is all very well to say labor should be allowed to
look after itself, and none of this paternalism. Of
course, the paternalism can be overdone and unwisely
done. But, at least where women workers are concerned,
if we are going to wait till they are able to do
things for themselves we are going to wait, perhaps,
too long for the social good while we are airing our
theories. It is something like saying that children
would be better off and have more strength of character
if they learned to look after themselves. But you
can start that theory too young and have the child
die on your hands, or turn into a gutter waif. The
child needs entire looking after up to a point where
he can begin little by little to look after himself.
And after he has learned to dress himself it does not
necessarily mean he can select his own food, his hour
of retiring, his habits of cleanliness and hygiene.</p>

<p>I look about at the laundry workers and think:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Suppose we decide nothing shall be done for these
girls until they demand it themselves and then have
charge of it themselves. In other words, suppose
we let welfare work and social legislation wait on
organization. The people who talk that way are
often college professors or the upper crust of labor.
They have either had no touch or lost touch with the
rank and file of women workers. It is going to be
years and years and years, if ever, before women in
this country organize by and large to a point where
they can become permanently effective. What organization
demands more than any other factor is,
first, a sense of oppression; second, surplus energy.
Women have been used to getting more or less the
tag end of things for some thousands of years. Why
expect them suddenly, in a second of time, as it were,
to rear up and say, &#8220;We'll not stand for this and
that&#8221;? If we are going to wait for working women
to feel oppressed enough to weld themselves together
into a militant class organization, capable of demanding
certain conditions and getting them, we shall wait
many a long day. In the meantime, we are putting
off the very situation we hope for&mdash;when women, as
well as men, shall have reached the point where they
can play a dignified part in the industrial scheme of
things&mdash;by sending them from work at night too
weary and run down to exert themselves for any
social purpose. I say that anything and everything
which can be done to make women more capable of
responsibility should be done. But the quickest and
sanest way to bring that about is not to sit back and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wait for factory women to work out their own salvation.
Too few of them have the intelligence or
gumption to have the least idea how to go about it,
did it ever occur to them that things might be
radically improved. (And the pity of it is that so
often telling improvements could be made with so
little effort.)</p>

<p>Nor is it anything but feminist sentimentality, as
far as I can see, to argue against special legislation
for women. What women can do intellectually as
compared with men I am in no position to state.
To argue that women can take a place on a physical
equality with man is simply not being honest.
Without sentimentalizing over motherhood, it seems
allowable to point out the fact that women are potential
mothers, and this fact, with every detail of
its complexities, feminists or no to the contrary, is a
distinct handicap to women's playing a part in the
industrial field on a par with man. And society
pays more dearly for a weary woman than for a
tired man.</p>

<p>Therefore, why not lunch rooms, and attractive
lunch rooms, and good food, well cooked? Yes, it is
good business, and besides it puts a woman on a
much more efficient level to herself and society. At
our tables the girls were talking about different
lunch-room conditions they had come across in their
work. One girl told of a glass company she had
worked for that recently was forced to shut down.
She dwelt feelingly on the white lunch room and the
good food, and especially the paper napkins&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
only place she had worked where they gave napkins.
She claimed there was not a girl who did not want
to cry when she had to quit that factory. &#8220;Everybody
loved it,&#8221; she said. I tried to find out if she
felt the management had been paying for the polished
brass rails, the good food, and the napkins out of the
workers' wages. &#8220;Not on your life!&#8221; she answered.
She had been a file clerk.</p>

<p>Take dental clinics in the factories. Four teeth on
our floor were extracted while I was at the laundry.
For a couple of days each girl moaned and groaned
and made everybody near her miserable. Then she
got Miss Cross's permission to go to some quack
dentist, and out came the tooth. Irma had two out
at one dollar each. It was going to cost her forty
dollars to get them back in. A person with his or
her teeth in good condition is a far better citizen than
one suffering from the toothache.</p>

<p>If I had my way I should like to see a rest room in
every factory where women are employed, and some
time, however short, allowed in the middle of the
afternoon to make use of it.</p>

<p>Eight hours is long enough for any woman to do
sustained physical work, with no possibility for
overtime.</p>

<p>Nor have we so much as touched on what it means
to live on thirteen dollars or fourteen dollars a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then you have taken away all the arguments
for organization!&#8221;</p>

<p>Should organization be considered as an end in
and of itself, or as one possible means to an end?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Word was passed this morning that &#8220;company&#8221;
was coming! The bustling and the hustling and the
dusting! Every girl had to clean her press from top
to bottom, and we swept the floor with lightning
speed. Miss Cross dashed to her little mirror and
put powder on her nose. Hattie tied a curtain around
her head to look like a Red Cross nurse. Every time
the door opened we all got expectant palpitations.
We were not allowed to speak, yet ever and anon
Hattie or Mrs. Reilly would let out some timely
remarks. Whereat we all got the giggles. Miss
Cross would almost hiss, &#8220;<small>GIRLS</small>!&#8221; whereat we subsided.
It was nerve wracking. And the company
never came! They got as far as the third floor and
gave out. But it was not until afternoon that we
knew definitely that our agony was for naught.</p>

<p>Lucia's machine got out of order&mdash;steam escaped
at a fearful rate. While the mechanic was fixing it
he discoursed to me on the laundry. He had been
there nine months&mdash;big, capable-looking six-footer.
Out of the corner of his mouth he informed me,
&#8220;Once anybody comes to work here they never
leave!&#8221; It surely does seem as if they had no end of
people who had worked there years and years. Miss
Cross says they used to have more fun than nowadays,
before so many colored girls were employed.
They gave parties and dances and everyone was
chummy with everyone else.</p>

<p>To-day, in the midst of hilarity and all unannounced,
&#8220;company&#8221; did appear. We subsided like
a schoolroom when the teacher suddenly re-enters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
A batch of women, escorted by one of the management.
He gesticulated and explained. I could not
catch his words, for the noise of the presses, though
goodness knows I craned my ears. They investigated
everything. Undoubtedly their guide dwelt eloquently
on the victrola in the lunch room; it plays
every noon. On their way out two of the young
women stopped by my press. &#8220;Didn't this girl iron
that nightgown nicely?&#8221; one said to the other. I
felt it obligatory to give them the &#8220;once over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second the door was closed I dashed for
Miss Cross. &#8220;Who were them females?&#8221; I asked
her.</p>

<p>Miss Cross grunted. &#8220;Them were Teachers College
girls.&#8221; She wrinkled her nose. &#8220;They send 'em
over here often. And let me tell <i>you</i>, I never seen
<i>one</i> of 'em with any class <i>yet</i>.... They talk about
college girls&mdash;pooh! I never seen a college girl yet
looked any classier than us laundry girls. Most of
'em don't look <i>as</i> classy. Only difference is, if you
mixed us all up, they're gettin' educated.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of my erstwhile jobs at the University of
California had been piloting college girls around
through factories in just that fashion. I had to laugh
in my sleeve as I suspected the same remarks may
have been passed on us after our departure!</p>


<p class="thought">We have much fun at our lunch table. A switchboard
operator and file clerk from the office eats with
us. She and I &#8220;guy&#8221; each other a good deal during
the meal. Miss Cross wipes her eyes and sighs:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
&#8220;Gee! Ain't it fun to laugh!&#8221; and Eleanor and I
look pleased with ourselves.</p>

<p>In the paper this morning appeared a picture of
one of New York's leading society women &#8220;experiencing
the life of the working girl first hand.&#8221; She
was shown in a French bonnet, a bunch of orchids at
her waist, standing behind a perfumery counter.
What our table did to Mrs. X!</p>

<p>&#8220;These women,&#8221; fusses Miss Cross, &#8220;who think
they'll learn what it's like to be a working girl, and
stand behind a perfumery counter! Somebody's
always trying to find out what it's like to be a worker&mdash;and
then they get a lot of noteriety writin' articles
about it. All rot, I say. Pity, if they really want to
know what workin's like, they wouldn't try a
laundry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She couldn't eat her breakfast in bed if she did
that!&#8221; was my cutting remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or quit at three,&#8221; from Annie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hisst!&#8221; I whisper, &#8220;I'm a lady in disguise!&#8221;
And I quirk my little finger as I drink my coffee and
order Eleanor to peer without to see if my limousine
waits.</p>

<p>We discuss rich folk and society ladies, and no one
envies or is bitter. Miss Cross guesses some of them
think they get as weary flying around to their parties
and trying on clothes as we do in the laundry. I
guess she is partly right.</p>

<p>Then we discuss what a bore it would be not to
work. At our table sit Miss Cross, Edna (Miss Cross
calls her Edner), the Cuban girl, who refused to eat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with the colored girls; Annie, the English girl, who
had worked in a retail shoe shop in London; Mrs.
Reilly, who is always morose at lunch and never
speaks, except one day when she and Miss Cross
nearly came to blows over religion. Each got purple
in the face. Then it came out that there was a feud
between them&mdash;two years or more it had lasted&mdash;and
neither ever speaks to the other. (Yet Mrs. Reilly
gave one dollar, twice as much as the rest of us,
toward Miss Cross's Christmas present.) Then
there are three girls from the office downstairs.
Everyone there had had some experience in being
out of work or not working. To each of them at such
a time life has been a wearisome thing. Each declared
she would 'most rather work at any old thing
than stay home and do nothing.</p>

<p>Between the first and second bells after lunch the
sixth-floor girls foregather and sit on the ironing
tables, swing our heels, and pass the time of day.
To-day I start casually singing, &#8220;Jesus Wants Me
for a Sunbeam.&#8221; Everyone on our floor knows the
song and there the whole lot of us sit, swinging our
heels, singing at the top of our lungs, &#8220;A <i>sunbeam</i>, a
<i>sunbeam</i>, Jesus wants me for a <i>sunbeam</i>,&#8221; which is
how I got the name of &#8220;Sunbeam&#8221; on our floor.
Except that Miss Cross, for some reason of her own,
usually called me &#8220;Constance.&#8221;</p>

<p>I teach them &#8220;My Heart's a Little Bird Cage,&#8221;
and we add that to our repertoire. Then we go on
to &#8220;Nearer, My God, to Thee,&#8221; &#8220;Lead, Kindly
Light,&#8221; &#8220;Rock of Ages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears we are a very religious lot on our floor.
All the colored girls are Baptists. Miss Cross is an
ardent Presbyterian, Annie is an Episcopalian, Edna
and Mrs. Reilly are Catholics, but Edna knows all
the hymns we daily sing.</p>

<p>And, lo! before many days I am startled by hearing
Lucia sing&mdash;woebegone Lucia. She sings to no tune
whatever and smiles at me, &#8220;Sunbeam, Sunbeam,
Sunbeam, Sunbeam.&#8221; So she has learned one English
word in sixteen years. That is better in quality
than German Tessie did. She told me, at the candy
factory, that the first thing she learned in English
was &#8220;son of a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact Lucia does know two other
words. Once I ironed a very starched nightgown.
It was a very, very large and gathered nightgown.
I held it up and made Lucia look at it.</p>

<p>Lucia snickered. &#8220;Da big-a, da fat-a!&#8221; said
Lucia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reilly let out a squeal. &#8220;She's learnt English!&#8221;
Mrs. Reilly called down the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; I announce, &#8220;I'll teach her 'da small-a,
da thin-a.'&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter I held up garments to which those
adjectives might apply, and tried to &#8220;learn&#8221; Lucia
additional English. Lucia giggled and giggled and
waited every evening to walk down the six flights of
stairs with me, and three blocks until our ways
parted. Each time I patted her on the back when
we started off and chortled: &#8220;Hey, Lucia, da big-a,
da fat-a!&#8221; Lucia would giggle again, and that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
all we would have to say. Except one night Lucia
pointed to the moon and said, &#8220;Luna.&#8221; So I make
the most of knowing that much Italian.</p>

<p>Oh yes, Lucia and I had one other thing in common.
One day at the laundry I found myself humming a
Neapolitan love song, from a victrola record we have.
Lucia's face brightened. The rest of the afternoon I
hummed the tune and Lucia sang the words of that
song, much to Mrs. Reilly's delight, who informed
the floor that now, for sure, Lucia was in love again.</p>

<p>There was much singing on our floor. Irma used
often to croon negro religious songs, the kind parlor
entertainers imitate. I loved to listen to her. It
was not my clothes she was ironing. Hattie, down the
line, mostly dwelt on &#8220;Jesus wants me for a Sunbeam.&#8221;
Hattie had straight, short hair that stood
out all over her head, and a face like a negro kewpie.
She was up to mischief seven hours of the nine, nor
could Miss Cross often subdue her. Hattie had been
on our floor four years. One lively day Irma was
singing with gusto &#8220;Abide With Me.&#8221; For some
reason I had broken into the rather unfactory-like
ballad of &#8220;Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young
Charms,&#8221; and Lucia was caroling some Italian song
lustily&mdash;all of us at one and the same time. Finally
Miss Cross called over, &#8220;For land's sakes, two of you
girls stop singing!&#8221; Since Irma and I were the only
two of the three to understand her, we made Christian
martyrs of ourselves and let Lucia have the floor.</p>

<p>Miss Cross was concerned once as to how I happened
to know so many hymns. Green earrings do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
not look particularly hymny. The fact was, I had
not thought of most of the hymns our sixth floor
sang since I was knee high. In those long ago days
a religious grandmother took me once to a Methodist
summer camp meeting, at which time I resolved
before my Maker to join the Salvation Army and beat
a tambourine. So when Miss Cross asked me how I
knew so many hymns, and the negro-revivalist
variety, I answered that I once near joined the Salvation
Army. &#8220;You don't say!&#8221; said the amazed
Miss Cross.</p>

<p>One day Miss Cross and Jacobs, a Jew who bossed
some department which brought him often to our
floor, to see, for instance, should they wash more
curtains or do furniture covers, had a great set-to on
the subject of religion. Jacobs was an iconoclast.
Edna left her handkerchiefs to join in. I eavesdropped
visibly. Jacobs 'lowed there was no hell.
Whereat Miss Cross and Edna wanted to know the
sense of being good. Jacobs 'lowed there was no
such thing as a soul. Miss Cross and Edna fairly
clutched each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is there that makes you happy or
unhappy, if it ain't your soul?&#8221; asked Miss Cross,
clenchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; grunted Jacobs, impatiently, after
having just argued there was no such place.</p>

<p>Jacobs uttered much heresy. Miss Cross and Edna
perspired in anguish. Then I openly joined the group.</p>

<p>Miss Cross turned to me. &#8220;I tell you how I feel
about Christianity. If a lot of these educated college<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
professors and lawyers and people like that, when
they read all the books they do and are smart as
they are&mdash;if Christianity is good enough for them,
it's good enough for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jacobs was so disgusted that he left.</p>

<p>Whereat Edna freed her soul of all the things she
wanted to say about hell and punishment for sins.
She went too far for Miss Cross. Edna spoke of
thieves and murderers and evildoers in general, and
what they ought to get in both this world and the
next. Quite a group had collected by this time.</p>

<p>Then Miss Cross turned to us all and said: &#8220;We're
in no position to pass judgment on people that do
wrong. Look at us. Here we are, girls what have
everything. We got nice homes, enough to eat and
wear, we have 'most everything in the world we want.
We don't know what it's like to be tempted, 'cause
we're so fortunate. An' I say we shouldn't talk
about people who go wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&mdash;in a laundry.</p>

<p>And only Edna seemed not to agree.</p>


<p class="thought">To-day at lunch the subject got around to matrimony.
Eleanor said: &#8220;Any girl can get married, if
she wants to so bad she'll take any old thing, but
who wants to take any old thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; I added, cockily. &#8220;Who wants to pick up
with anyone they can vamp in the Subway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon I get sat upon and the line of argument
was interesting. Thus it ran:</p>

<p>After all, why wasn't a man a girl vamped in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Subway the safest kind? Where did working girls
get a chance to meet men, anyhow? About the only
place was the dance hall, and goodness knows what
kind of men you did meet at a dance hall. They were
apt to be the kind to make questionable husbands;
like as not they were &#8220;sports.&#8221; But the Subway!
Now there you were more likely to pick up with the
dependable kind. Every girl at the table knew one
or several married couples whose romances had begun
on the Subway, and &#8220;every one of 'em turned out
happy.&#8221; One girl told of a man she could have
vamped the Sunday before in the Subway, but he
was too sportily dressed and she got scared and quit
in the middle. The other girls all approved her conduct.
Each expressed deep suspicion of the &#8220;sporty&#8221;
man. Each supported the Subway romance.</p>

<p>I withdrew my slur on the same.</p>


<p class="thought">A guilty feeling came over me as the day for leaving
the laundry approached. Miss Cross and I had become
very friendly. We planned to do all sorts of
things together. Our floor was such a companionable,
sociable place. It didn't seem square to walk
off and leave those girls, black and white, who were
my friends. In the other factories I just disappeared
as suddenly as I came. After a few days I could not
stand it and penned a jiggly note to Miss Cross.
Unexpectedly, I was going to have to move to
Pennsylvania (that was true, for Christmas vacation).
I hated to leave her and the girls, etc., etc. I was her
loving friend, &#8220;Constance,&#8221; alias &#8220;Sunbeam.&#8221;</p>



<h3><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></h3>

<h4><i>In a Dress Factory</i></h4>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">F</span>ingers</span> poke through cold holes in the wool
mittens; the old coat with two buttons gone
flaps and blows about the knees; dirt, old papers,
spiral upward on the chill gusts of a raw winter day.
Close your eyes, duck your head, and hurry on.
Under one arm is clutched the paper bag with lunch
and the blue-checked apron. Under the other the
old brown-leather bag. In the old brown-leather
bag is an old black purse. In the old black purse
are fifty-five cents, a key, and a safety pin. In the
old brown bag are also two sticks of Black Jack
chewing gum, a frayed handkerchief, and the crumpled
list of possibilities. If you should lose the list!</p>

<p>That list was copied from the Sunday <i>World</i>&mdash;from
the &#8220;Female Help Wanted, Miscellaneous.&#8221;
The future looked bright Sunday. Now after four
attempts to land jobs had ended in being turned
down cold, the future did not look bright at all.
Because, you understand, we are going on the assumption
that the old black purse in the old brown
bag with fifty-five cents and a key and a safety pin
were all that stood between us and&mdash;well, a number
of dismal things. Which was fifty-five cents and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
key and a safety pin more than some folk had that
Monday morning in New York.</p>

<p>You must know in days of unemployment that it
is something of a catastrophe if you do not land the
first job you apply for Monday morning. For by the
time you reach the second place on the list, no matter
how fast you go, it is apt to be filled up from the group
who were waiting there from 7.30 on, as you had
waited at your first hope. The third chance is
slimmer still by far, and if you keep on until 10 or 11
it is mostly just plain useless.</p>

<p>And if you do not land a job Monday, that whole
week is as good as lost. Of course, there is always a
chance&mdash;the smallest sort of hopeless chance&mdash;that
something can be found later on in the week. The
general happening is that you stake your all on the
7.30 to 8.30 wait Monday morning. Often it is 9
before the firm sees fit to announce it wants no more
help, and there you are with fifty-five cents and a key
and a safety pin&mdash;or less&mdash;to do till Monday next.</p>

<p>Strange the cruel comfort to be felt from the sight
of the countless others hurrying about hopelessly,
hopefully, that raw Monday morning. On every
block where a firm had advertised were girls scanning
their already worn-looking lists, making sure of
the address, hastening on. Nor were they deterred
by the procession marching away&mdash;even if some one
called, &#8220;No use goin' up there&mdash;they don't want no
more.&#8221; Perhaps, after all, thought each girl to herself,
the boss would want <i>her</i>. The boss did not.</p>

<p>First, early in the morning and full of anticipation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I made for the bindery on West Eighteenth Street.
That sounded the likeliest of the possibilities. No
need to get out the paper to make sure again of the
number. It must be where that crowd was on the
sidewalk ahead, some thirty girls and as many men
and boys. Everyone was pretty cheerful&mdash;it was
twenty minutes to eight and most of us were young.
Rather too many wanted the same job, but there
were no worries to speak of. Others might be unlucky&mdash;not
we. So our little group talked. Bright
girls they were, full of giggles and &#8220;gee's.&#8221; Finally
the prettiest and the brightest of the lot peered in
through the street doors. &#8220;Say, w'at d'ye know?
I see a bunch inside! Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>In we shoved our way, and there in the dismal
basement-like first floor waited as many girls and
men as on the sidewalk. &#8220;Good night! A fat show
those dead ones outside stand!&#8221; And we passed the
time of day a bit longer. The pretty and smart one
was not for such tactics long. &#8220;W'at d'ye say we
go up to where the firm is and beat the rest of 'em
to it!&#8221; &#8220;You said it!&#8221; And we tore up the iron
stairs. On the second flight we passed a janitor.
&#8220;Where's the bindery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighth floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; And up seven flights we puffed in
single file, conversation impossible for lack of wind.</p>

<p>The bright one opened the door and our group of
nine surged in. There stood as many girls and men
as were down on the first floor and out on the sidewalk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; There was nothing else to say.</p>

<p>We edged our way through till we stood by the
time clock. The bright one was right,&mdash;that was the
strategic point. For at 8.30 a forelady appeared at
that very spot, just suddenly was&mdash;and in a pleasant
tone of voice announced, &#8220;We don't need any more
help, male or female, this morning!&#8221; Two scared-looking
girls just in front of me screwed up their
courage and said, pleadingly, &#8220;But you told us
Saturday we should come back this morning and you
promised us work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right! Then you two go to the coat
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone looked a bit dazed. At least one hundred
girls and over that many men had hopes of
landing a job at that bindery&mdash;and they took on two
girls from Saturday.</p>

<p>We said a few things we thought, and dashed for
the iron stairs. We rushed down pell-mell, calling
all the way. By this time a steady procession was
filing up. &#8220;No use. Save your breath.&#8221; Some kept
on, regardless.</p>

<p>From the bindery I rushed to a factory making
muslin underwear. By the time I got there&mdash;only
six blocks uptown&mdash;the boss looked incredulous that
I should even be applying at such an advanced
hour, although it was not yet 9. No, he needed no
more. From there to the address of an &#8220;ad&#8221; for
&#8220;light factory work,&#8221; whatever it might turn out to
be. A steady stream of girls coming and going.
Upstairs a young woman, without turning her head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
her finger tracing down a column of figures, called
out, &#8220;No more help wanted!&#8221;</p>

<p>A rush to a wholesale millinery just off Fifth
Avenue&mdash;the only millinery advertising for learners.
The elevator was packed going up, the hallway was
packed where we got out. The girls already there
told us newcomers we must write our names on
certain cards. Also we must state our last position,
what sort of millinery jobs we expected to get, and
what salary. The girl ahead of me wrote twenty-eight
dollars. I wrote fourteen dollars. She must
have been experienced in some branch of the trade.
All the rest of us at our crowded end of the entry
hall were learners. The &#8220;ad&#8221; here had read &#8220;apply
after 9.30.&#8221; It was not yet 9.30. A few moments
after I got there, my card just filled out, the boss
called from a little window: &#8220;No more learners.
All I want is one experienced copyist.&#8221; There was
apparently but one experienced copyist in the whole
lot. Everyone was indignant. Several girls spoke
up: &#8220;What made you advertise learners if you
don't want none?&#8221; &#8220;I did want some, but I got all
I want.&#8221; We stuffed the elevator and went on down.</p>

<p>As a last try, my lunch and apron and I tore for
the Subway and Park Place, down by the Woolworth
Building. By the time I reached that bindery there
were only two girls ahead of me. A man interviewed
the younger. She had had a good bit of bindery experience.
The man was noncommittal. The very
refined middle-aged woman had had years of experience.
She no sooner spoke of it than the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
squinted his eyes at her and said: &#8220;You belong to
the union then, don't you?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; the woman
admitted, with no hesitation, &#8220;I do, but that makes
no difference. I'm perfectly willing to work with
nonunion girls. I'm a good worker and I don't see
what difference it should make.&#8221; The man turned
abruptly to me. &#8220;What bindery experience have
you had?&#8221; I had to admit I had had no bindery experience,
but I made it clear I was a very experienced
person in many other fields&mdash;oh, many other&mdash;and so
willing I was, and quick to learn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had advertised for learners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but why should I use learners when I turned
away over seventy experienced girls this morning,
ready to do any work for any old price?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was hoping to hear what else he might say to the
union member, but the man left me no excuse for
standing around.</p>

<p>I ate my lunch at home.</p>

<p>When the next Sunday morning came, again the
future looked bright. I red-penciled eleven &#8220;ads&#8221;&mdash;jobs
in three different dress factories, sewing buttons
on shoes. You see, I have to pick only such &#8220;ads&#8221;
as allow for no previous experience&mdash;it is only unskilled
workers I am eligible to be among as yet;
girls to pack tea and coffee, to work for an envelope
company, in tobacco, on sample cards; girls to pack
hair nets, learners on fancy feathers, and learners to
operate book-sewing machines.</p>

<p>The rest of the newspaper told much of trouble in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the garment trades. I decided to try the likeliest
dress factory first. I was hopeful, but not enough so
to take my lunch and apron.</p>

<p>At the first dress factory address before eight o'clock
there were about nine girls ahead of me. We waited
downstairs by the elevator, as the boss had not yet
arrived. The &#8220;ad&#8221; I was answering read: &#8220;<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>&mdash;Bright
girls to make themselves useful around dress
factory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of us looked brighter than others of us.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the hall we assembled to wait upon the
pleasure of the boss. The woodwork was white, the
floor pale blue&mdash;it was all very impressive.</p>

<p>Finally, second try, the boss glued his eye on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in here.&#8221; A white door closed behind us,
and we stood in a little room which looked as if a
small boy of twelve had knocked it together out of
old scraps and odds and ends, unpainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What experience you have had?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a nice-looking, fairly young Jew, who
spoke with a considerable German accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;None in a dress factory, but ...&#8221; and I regaled
him with the vast amount of experience in other
lines that was mine, adding that I had done a good
deal of &#8220;private dressmaking&#8221; off and on, and also
assuring him, almost tremblingly, I did so want to
land a job&mdash;that I was the most willing of workers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you expect to get?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you pay me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I'm asking you. What do you expect to
get?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, go on in.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the room where the boss had received me
could have been the work of a twelve-year-old, the
rest of the factory must have been designed and
executed by a boy of eight, or a lame, halt, and blind
carpenter just tottering to his grave. There was not
a straight shelf. There was not a straight partition.
Boards of various woods and sizes had been used and
nothing had ever been painted. Such doors as existed
had odd ways of opening and closing. The whole
place looked as if it had cost about seven dollars and
twenty-nine cents to throw together. But, ah! the
white and pale blue of the show rooms!</p>


<p class="thought">The dress factory job was like another world compared
with candy, brass, and the laundry. In each
of those places I had worked on one floor of a big
plant, doing one subdivided piece of labor among
equally low-paid workers busy at the same sort of
job as myself. Of what went on in the processes
before and after the work we did, I knew and saw
nothing. We packed finished chocolates; we punched
slots in already-made lamp cones; we ironed already
washed, starched, and dampened clothes. Such
work as we did took no particular skill, though a
certain improvement in speed and quality of work
came with practice. One's eyes could wander now
and then, one's thoughts could wander often, and
conversation with one's neighbors was always
possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold the dress factory, a little complete world
of its own on one small floor where every process of
manufacture, and all of it skilled work, could be
viewed from any spot. Not quite every process&mdash;the
designer had a room of her own up front nearer
where the woodwork was white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready-made clothing!&#8221; It sounds so simple&mdash;just
like that. Mrs. Fine Lady saunters into a shop,
puts up her lorgnette, and lisps, &#8220;I'd like to see
something in a satin afternoon dress.&#8221; A plump
blonde in tight-fitting black with a marcel wave
trips over to mirrored doors, slides one back, takes a
dress off its hanger&mdash;and there you are! &#8220;So much
simpler than bothering with a dressmaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>But whatever happened to get that dress to the
place where the blonde could sell it? &#8220;Ready-made,&#8221;
indeed! There has to be a start some place
before there is any &#8220;made&#8221; to it. It was at that
point in our dress factory when the French designer
first got a notion into her head&mdash;she who waved her
arms and gesticulated and flew into French-English
rages just the way they do on the stage. &#8220;<i>Mon
Dieu! Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221;&mdash;gray-haired Madame would
gasp at our staid and portly Mr. Rogers. Ada could
say &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221; through her Russian nose to him
and it had nothing like the same wilting effect.</p>

<p>Ready-made&mdash;yes, ready-made. But first Madame
got her notion, and then she and her helpers
concocted the dress itself. A finished article, it hung
inside the wire inclosure where the nice young cutter
kept himself and his long high table. The cutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
took a look at the finished garment hanging on the
side of his cage, measured a bit with his yardstick,
and then proceeded to cut the pattern out of paper.
Whereupon he laid flat yards and yards of silks and
satins on his table and with an electric cutter sliced
out his parts. One mistake&mdash;one slice off the line&mdash;<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> it's too terrible to think of! All these
pieces had to be sorted according to sizes and colors,
and tied and labeled. (Wanted&mdash;bright and useful
girl right here.)</p>

<p>Next came the sewing machine operators (electric
power)&mdash;a long narrow table, nine machines at a
side, but not more than fourteen operators were employed&mdash;thirteen
girls and one lone young man.
They said that on former piece rates this man used
to make from ninety dollars to one hundred dollars
a week. The operators were all well paid, especially
by candy, brass, and laundry standards, but they
were a skilled lot. A very fine-looking lot too&mdash;some
of the nicest-looking girls I've seen in New York.
Everyone had a certain style and assurance. It was
good for the eyes to look on them after the laundry
thirteen-dollar-a-week type.</p>

<p>When the first operators had done their part the
dresses were handed over to the drapers. There
were two drapers; they were getting around fifty
dollars a week before the hard times. One of the
drapers was as attractive a girl as I ever saw any
place&mdash;bobbed hair, deep-set eyes, a Russian Jewess
with features which made her look more like an
Italian. She spoke English with hardly any accent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
She dressed very quietly and in excellent taste.
All day long the two draped dresses on forms&mdash;ever
pinning and pinning. The drapers turned the
dresses over to certain operators, who finished all
machine sewing. The next work fell to the finishers.</p>

<p>In that same end of the factory sat the four
finishers, getting &#8220;about twenty dollars a week,&#8221;
but again no one seemed sure. Two were Italians
who could talk little English. One was Gertie, four
weeks married&mdash;&#8220;to a Socialist.&#8221; Gertie was another
of the well-dressed ones. If you could know these
dress factory girls you would realize how, unless
gifted with the approach of a newspaper reporter&mdash;and
I lack that approach&mdash;it was next to impossible
to ask a girl herself what she was earning. No more
than you could ask a lawyer what his fees amounted
to. The girls themselves who had been working
long together in the same shop did not seem to know
what one another's wages were. It was a new state
of affairs in my factory experience.</p>

<p>The finishers, after sewing on all hooks and eyes
and fasteners and doing all the remaining handwork
on the dresses, turned them over to the two pressers,
sedate, assured Italians, who ironed all day long and
looked prosperous and were very polite.</p>

<p>They brought the dresses back to Jean and her
helper&mdash;two girls who put the last finishing touches
on a garment before it went into the showroom&mdash;snipping
here and there, rough edges all smoothed off. It
was to Jean the boss called my second morning, very
loud so all could hear: &#8220;If you find anything wrong mit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a dress, don't <i>look</i> at it, don't <i>bodder wid</i> it&mdash;jus'
t'row it in dere faces and made dem do it over again!
It's not like de old days no more!&#8221; (Whatever he
meant by that.) So&mdash;there was your dress, &#8220;ready-made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such used to be the entire factory, adding the two
office girls; the model, who was wont to run around
our part of the world now and then in a superior
fashion, clad in a scanty pale-pink-satin petticoat
which came just below her knees and an old gray-and-green
sweater; plus various male personages,
full of business and dressed in their best. Goodness
knows what all they did do to keep the wheels of
industry running&mdash;perhaps they were salesmen. They
had the general appearance of earning at least ten to
twenty thousand dollars a year. It may possibly
have risen as high as two thousand.</p>

<p>And Peters&mdash;who was small though grown, and
black, and who cleaned up with a fearful dust and
snitched lead pencils if you left them around.</p>

<p>At present, in addition, there were the sixteen
crochet beaders, because crochet beading is stylish
in certain quarters&mdash;this &#8220;department&#8221; newly added
just prior to my arrival. But before the beaders
could begin work the goods had to be stamped, and
before they could be stamped Mr. Rogers (he was
middle-aged and a dear and an Italian and his name
wasn't &#8220;Rogers,&#8221; but some unpronounceable thing
the Germans couldn't get, so it just naturally evolved
into something that began with the same letter
which they could pronounce) had to concoct a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
design. He worked in the cage at a raised end of the
cutting table. He pricked the pattern through
paper with a machine, at a small table outside by the
beaders, that was always piled high with a mess of
everything from spools to dresses, which Mr. Rogers
patiently removed each time to some spot where
some one else found them on top of something she
wanted, and less patiently removed them to some
other spot, where still less patiently they were found
in the way and dumped some place else. Such was
life in one factory. And Ada would call out still
later: &#8220;Mr. Rogers, did you see a pile of dresses on
this table when you went to work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereat in abject politeness and dismay Mr.
Rogers would dash from &#8220;inside&#8221; to &#8220;outside&#8221; and
explain in very broken English that there had been
some things on the table, but &#8220;vaire carefully&#8221; he
had placed them&mdash;here. And to Mr. Rogers's
startled gaze the pile had disappeared.</p>

<p>If a dress had to be beaded, Mr. Rogers took the
goods after the cutter finished his job, and he and
his helpers stamped the patterns on sleeves, front
and back, skirt, by rubbing chalk over the paper.
Upon the scene at this psychological moment enters
the bright girl to make herself useful. The bright
girl &#8220;framed-up&#8221; the goods for the beaders to work
on. (In fact, you noted she entered even earlier, by
helping the cutter tie the bundles according to size
and color.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Frame-up&#8221; means taking boards the proper length
with broad tape tacked along one edge. First you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pin the goods lengthwise, pins close together. Then
you find side boards the desired length and pin the
goods along the sides. Then with four iron clamps
you fasten the corners together, making the goods as
tight as a drum. There is a real knack to it, let me
tell you&mdash;especially when it comes to queerly shaped
pieces&mdash;odd backs or fronts or sleeves. Or where
you have a skirt some six or eight feet long and three
broad. But I can frame! Ada said so.</p>

<p>When I got a piece framed (Now I write those six
words and grin) ... &#8220;<i>when</i>&#8221; ... Two little skinny
horses I had to rest the frames upon. The space I
had in which to make myself useful was literally
about three by four feet just in front of the shelves
where the thread and beads were kept. That is, I
had it if no one wanted to get anything in the line
of thread or beads, which they always did want to
get. Whereupon I moved out&mdash;which meant my
work might be knocked on the floor, or if it was bigger
I had to move the work out with me. Or I crawled
under it and got the thread or beads myself. If it
were a skirt I was framing up I earned the curses,
though friendly, of the assemblage. No one could
pass in any direction. The beaders were shut in
their quarters till I got through, or they crawled
under. Or I poked people in the back with the
frames while I was clamping them. I fought and
bled and died over every large frame I managed to
get together, for the frame was larger than the space
I had to work in. Until in compassion they finally
moved me around the corner into the dressmaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
quarters, which tried Joe's soul. Joe was the Italian
foreman of that end of things. He was nice. But he
saw no reason why I should be moved up into his
already crowded space. Indeed, I was only a little
better off. The fact of the matter was that the more
useful I became the more in everybody's way I got.
Indeed, it can be taken as a tribute to human nature
that everyone in that factory was not a crabbed
nervous wreck from having to work on top of everyone
else. It was almost like attempting dressmaking
in the Subway. The boss at times would gaze upon
my own frantic efforts, and he claimed: &#8220;Every time
I look at you the tears come in my eis.&#8221; And I
would tell him, &#8220;Every time I think about myself
the tears come in mine.&#8221; About every other day he
appeared with a hammer and some nails and would
pound something some place, with the assurance that
his every effort spelled industrial progress and
especial help to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I think on is your comfort, yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't get gray over it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor will I forget that exhibition of the boss's ideas
of scientific management. Nothing in the factory
was ever where anyone could find it. It almost drove
me crazy. What was my joy then when one day the
boss told me to put the spools in order. There was a
mess of every-colored spool, mixed with every other
color, tangled ends, dust, buttons, loose snappers,
more dust, beads, more spools, more dust. A certain
color was wanted by a stitcher. There was nothing
to do but paw. The spool, like as not, would be so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
dusty it would take blowings and wipings on your
skirt before it could be discovered whether the color
was blue or black. I tied my head in tissue paper
and sat down to the dusty job of sorting those spools.
Laboriously I got all the blacks together and in one
box. Laboriously all the whites. That exhausted
all the boxes I could lay hands on. I hunted up the
boss. &#8220;I can't do that spool job decent if I ain't got
no boxes to put the different colors in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boxes, boxes! What for you want boxes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the spools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Ain't you got no boxes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;'Ain't got another one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hustled around to the spool shelves where I
was working.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, boxes! Here are two boxes. What more
you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Majestically, energetically, he dumped my black
spools out of one box, my white spools out of the
other&mdash;dumped them back with a flourish into the
mess of unassorted dust and colors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are two boxes! What more you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>What redress had I for such a grievance except to
wail at him: &#8220;My Gawd! my Gawd! I jus' put those
spools in them boxes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, so!&#8221; says the boss. &#8220;Vell, put um back in
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the sweat of my life's blood I unearthed a
ragged empty box here, another there, no two sizes
the same. After three days of using every minute to
be spared from other jobs on those shelves, I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
every single spool where it belonged and each box
labeled as to color. How wondrous grand it looked!
How clean and dusted! I made the boss himself
gaze upon the glory of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, fine!&#8221; he beamed.</p>

<p>Two days later it was as if I had never touched a
spool. The boxes were broken, the spools spilled
all over&mdash;pawing was again in season. Not yet quite
so much dust, but soon even the dust would be as
of yore.</p>

<p>&#8220;One cause of labor unrest is undoubtedly the fact
that the workers are aware that present management
of industry is not always 100 per cent efficient.&#8221;</p>


<p class="thought">So then, I framed up. Nor was it merely that I
worked under difficulties as to space. Another of the
boss's ideas of scientific management seemed to be
to employ as few bright and useful girls as possible.
He started with three. He ended with just one.
From dawn to dewy eve I tore. It was &#8220;Connie,
come here!&#8221; (Ada, the beadwork forelady.) &#8220;Connie,
come here!&#8221; (The cutter.) &#8220;Connie, thread,
thread, yes? There's a good girl!&#8221; (The beaders.)
&#8220;Connie, changeable beads, yes? That's the girl!&#8221;
&#8220;Connie, unframe these two skirts quick as you
can!&#8221; &#8220;Connie, never mind finishing those skirts;
I got to get this 'special' framed up right away!&#8221;
&#8220;Connie, didn't you finish unframing those skirts?&#8221;
&#8220;Connie, tissue paper, yes? Thanks awfully.&#8221;
&#8220;Connie, did you see that tag I laid here? Look for
it, will you?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>But the choice and rare moment of my bright and
useful career was when the boss himself called, &#8220;Oh,
Miss Connie, come <i>mal</i> here, yes?&#8221; And when I got
<i>mal</i> there he said, &#8220;I want you should take my shoes
to the cobblers <i>so fort</i> yes?... And be sure you get
a check ... and go quick, yes.&#8221; Whereupon he removed
his shoes and shuffled about in a pair of
galoshes.</p>

<p>I put on the green tam. I put on the old brown
coat with now three buttons gone and the old fur collar,
over my blue-checked apron, and with the boss's
shoes under my arm out I fared, wishing to goodness
I would run into some one I knew, to chuckle with
me. Half an hour later the boss called me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is time you should bring my shoes back,
yes?&#8221; I went. The cobbler said it would be another
five minutes. Five minutes to do what I
would within New York! It was a wondrous sensation.
Next to the cobbler's a new building was
going up. I have always envied the folks who had
time to hang over a railing and watch a new building
going up. At last&mdash;my own self, my green tam, my
brown coat over the blue-checked apron, chewing a
stick of Black Jack, hung over the railing and for five
whole minutes and watched the men on the steel
skeleton. All the time my salary was going on just
the same.</p>

<p>I was hoping the boss would tip me&mdash;say, a dime&mdash;for
running his errands. Otherwise I might never
get a tip from anyone. He did not. He thanked me,
and after that he called me &#8220;dearie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Ada's face wore an anxious look when I got back.
She was afraid I might not have liked running errands.
Running errands, it seemed, was not exactly
popular. I assured her it was &#8220;so swell watchin' the
riveters on the new buildin'&#8221; I didn't care about the
shoes.</p>

<p>The first day in any new job seems strange, and
you wonder if you ever will get acquainted. In the
dress factory I felt that way for several days. Hitherto
I had always worked with girls all round me, and
it was no time before we were chatting back and forth.
In the dress factory I worked by myself at chores no
one else did. Also, the other girls had the sort of
jobs which took concentration and attention&mdash;there
was comparatively little talk. Also, the sewing
machines inside and the riveting on that steel building
outside made too much noise for easy conversation.</p>

<p>At lunch time most of the girls went out to eat at
various restaurants round about. They looked so
grand when they got their coats and hats on that I
could never see them letting me tag along in my old
green tam and two-out-of-five buttoned coat. My
wardrobe had all fitted in appropriately to candy and
brass and the laundry, but not to dressmaking. So
I ate my lunch out of a paper bag in the factory
with such girls as stayed behind. They were mostly
the beaders. And they were mostly &#8220;dead ones&#8221;&mdash;the
sort who would not talk had they been given a
bonus and share in the profits for it. They read the
<i>Daily News</i>, a group of some five to one paper, and ate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>By Thursday of the first week I was desperate.
How was I ever to &#8220;get next&#8221; to the dress factory
girls? During the lunch hour Friday I gulped down
my food and tore for Gimbel's, where I bought five
new buttons. Saturday I sewed them on my coat,
and Monday and all the next week I ate lunch with
Ada and Eva and Jean and Kate at a Yiddish restaurant
where the food had strange names and
stranger tastes. But at least there was conversation.</p>

<p>Ada I loved&mdash;our forelady in the bead work&mdash;young,
good-looking, intelligent. She rather took me
under her wing, in gratitude for which I showed
almost immediate improvement along those lines
whereon she labored over me. My grammar, for
instance. When I said &#8220;it ain't,&#8221; Ada would say,
&#8220;Connie, Connie, <i>ain't</i>!&#8221; Whereat I gulped and said
&#8220;isn't,&#8221; and Ada smiled approval. Within one week
I had picked up wonderfully. At the end of that week
Ada and I were quite chummy. She asked me one
day if I were married. No. Was she? &#8220;You don't
think I'd be working like this if I was, do you?&#8221;
When I asked her what she would be doing if she
didn't have to work, she answered, &#8220;Oh, lots of
things.&#8221; Nor could I pin her to details. She told
me she'd get married to-morrow only her &#8220;sweetheart&#8221;
was a poor man. But she was crazy about
him. Oh, she was! The very next day she flew over
to where I was framing up. &#8220;I've had a fight with
my sweetheart!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was always difficult carrying on a conversation
with Ada. She was being hollered for from every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
corner of the factory continually, and in the few
seconds we might have had for talk I was hollered
for. Especially is such jumpiness detrimental to
sharing affairs of the heart. I know only fragments
of Ada's romance. The fight lasted all of four days.
Then he appeared one evening, and next morning,
she beamingly informed me that &#8220;her sweetheart
had made up. Oh, but he's <i>some</i> lover, <i>I</i> tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ada was born in Russia, but came very young
to this country. She spoke English without an accent.
Never had she earned less than twenty dollars
a week, starting out as a bookkeeper. When crochet
beading first became the rage, about five years ago,
she went over to that and sometimes made fifty
dollars and sixty dollars a week. Here as forelady,
she made forty dollars. Twenty dollars of that she
gave each week to her mother for board and lodging.
Often she had gone on summer vacations. For three
years she had paid for a colored girl to do the housework
at home. I despaired at first of having Ada so
much as take notice of the fact that I was alive.
What was my joy then, at the end of the first week,
to have her come up and say to me: &#8220;Do you know
what I want? I want you to come over to Brooklyn
and live with me and my folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, it's wretched to just walk off and leave folks
like that!</p>

<p>That same Saturday morning the boss said he
wanted to see me after closing time. There seemed
numerous others he wanted to see. Then I discovered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
while waiting my turn with these others,
that practically no one there knew her &#8220;price.&#8221;
There was a good deal of resentment about it, too.
He had hired these girls and no word about pay.
The other girls waiting that morning were beaders.
I learned one trick of the trade which it appears is
more or less universal. They had left their former
jobs to come to this factory in answer to an &#8220;ad&#8221;
for crochet beaders. If after one week it was found
they were getting less than they had at the old place,
they would go back and say they had been sick for
a week. Otherwise they planned to stay on at this
factory. Each girl was called in alone, and alone
bargained with the boss. Monday, Sadie, just for
instance, ahead of me in the Saturday line, reported
the conversation she had had with the boss:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, miss, what you expect to get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I'm worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;you're worth one hundred dollars, but
I'm talking just plain English. What you expect to
get?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what I'm worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, you're worth one hundred dollars; you
think you'll get thirty dollars. I'll pay you twenty
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Sadie had previously told me under no consideration
would she remain under twenty-five dollars,
but she remained for twenty dollars.)</p>

<p>My turn. I thought there was no question about
my &#8220;price.&#8221; It was fourteen dollars. But perhaps
seeing how I had run my legs almost off, and pinned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
my fingers almost off all week, the boss was going
voluntarily to raise me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What wages you expect to get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, well, since he thus opened the question we
would begin all new. I had worked so much harder
than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen dollars a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho&mdash;sixteen dollars!&mdash;and last Monday it was
fourteen dollars. You're going up, yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the work's much harder 'n I thought it 'ud
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you go from fourteen dollars to sixteen dollars
and I got you here to tell you you'd get twelve
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, but I was mad&mdash;just plain mad! &#8220;You let
me work all week thinkin' I was gettin' fourteen
dollars. It ain't fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair? I pay you what I can afford. Times are
hard now, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not speak for my upset feelings. To pay
me twelve dollars for the endless labor of that week
when he had allowed me to think I was getting fourteen
dollars! To add insult to injury, he said,
&#8220;Next week I want you should work later than the
other girls evenings, and make no date for next
Saturday&#8221; (I had told him I was in a hurry to get
off for lunch this Saturday) &#8220;because I shall want you
should work Saturday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a state of affairs is indeed worth following
up....</p>

<p>Monday morning he came around breezily&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
really was a cordial, kindly soul&mdash;and said; &#8220;Well,
dearie, how are you this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>I went on pinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good as anybody can be on twelve dollars a
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, forget it, forget it! Always money, money!
Whether a person gets ten cents or three hundred
dollars&mdash;it's not the money that counts&#8221;&mdash;his hands
went up in the air&mdash;&#8220;it's the <i>service</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet employers tell labor managers they must not
sentimentalize.</p>

<p>A bit later he came back. &#8220;I tell you what I'll
do. You stay late every night this week and work
Saturday afternoon like I told you you should, and
I'll pay you for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>To such extremes a sense of justice can carry one!
(Actually, he had expected that extra work of me
gratis!)</p>

<p>During the week I figured out that in his own
heart that boss had figured out a moral equivalent
for a living wage. There was nothing he would
not do for me. Did he but come in my general
direction, I was given a helping hand. He joked
with me continually. The hammer and nails were
always busy. I was not only &#8220;dearie,&#8221; I was
&#8220;sweetheart.&#8221; But fourteen dollars a week&mdash;that
was another story.</p>

<p>Ada was full of compassion and suggested various
arguments I should use next week on the boss. It
was awful what he paid me, Ada declared. She too
would talk to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The second week I got closer to the girls. Or, more
truthfully put, they got closer to me. At the other
factories I had asked most of the questions and
answered fewer. Here I could hardly get a question
in edgewise for the flood which was let loose on me.
I explained in each factory that I lived with a widow
who brought me from California to look after her
children. I did some work for her evenings and
Saturday afternoon and Sunday, to pay for my room
and board. Not only was I asked every conceivable
question about myself, but at the dress factory I had
to answer uncountable questions about the lady I
lived with&mdash;her &#8220;gentlemen friends,&#8221; her clothes,
her expenses. It was like pulling teeth for me to
get any information out of the girls.</p>

<p>In such a matter as reading, for example. Every
girl I asked was fond of reading. What kind of
books? Good books. Yes, but the names. I got
<i>We Two</i> out of Sarah, and Jean was reading Ibsen's
<i>Doll's House</i>. It was a swell book, a play. After
hours one night she told me the story. Together
with Ada's concern over my grammar it can be seen
that I left the dress factory in intellectual advance
over the condition in which I entered.</p>

<p>The girls I had the opportunity of asking were not
such &#8220;movie&#8221; enthusiasts, on the whole. Only
now and then they went to &#8220;a show.&#8221; Less frequently
they spoke of going to the Jewish Theater.
No one was particularly excited over dancing&mdash;in
fact, Sarah, who looked the blond type of the dance-every-night
variety, thought dancing &#8220;disgusting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8221;
Shows weren't her style. She liked reading. Whenever
I got the chance I asked a girl what she did
evenings. The answer usually was, &#8220;Oh, nothing
much.&#8221; One Friday I asked a group of girls at lunch
if they weren't glad the next day was Saturday and
the afternoon off. Four of them weren't glad at all,
because they had to go home and clean house Saturday
afternoons, and do other household chores.
&#8220;Gee! don't you hate workin' round the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder how much of the women-in-industry
movement is traceable to just that.</p>

<p>The first day I was at the dress factory a very
dirty but pleasant-faced little Jewish girl said to me,
&#8220;Ever try workin' at home? Ain't it just awful?&#8221;
She had made thirty-two dollars a week beading at
her last place&mdash;didn't know what she'd get here.</p>

<p>I had hoped to hear murmurings and discussions
about the conditions of the garment trades and the
unions&mdash;not a word the whole time. Papers were
full of a strike to be called the next week throughout
the city, affecting thousands of waist and dress
makers. It might as well have been in London.
Not an echo of interest in it reached our factory.
I asked Sarah if she had ever worked in a union shop.
&#8220;Sure.&#8221; &#8220;Any different from this?&#8221; &#8220;Different?
You bet it's different. Boss wouldn't dare treat you
the way you get treated here.&#8221; But as usual I was
yelled for and got no chance ever to pin Sarah to
details.</p>

<p>A group of girls in the dressing room exploded one
night, &#8220;Gee! they sure treat you like dogs here! No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
soap, no towels&mdash;nothing.&#8221; The hours were good&mdash;8.30
to 12.15; 1 to 5.15. One Saturday Ada and the
boss asked the beaders to work in the afternoon. Not
one stayed. Too many had heard the tales of girls
working overtime and not being paid anything extra.</p>


<p class="thought">Wednesday I went back after my last week's pay.
When the cashier caught sight of me she was full of
interest. &#8220;I was writing you a letter this very day.
The boss wants you back awful badly. He's out
just now for lunch. Can't you wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the boss stepped from the elevator.
&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, here you are! Now, dearie, if it's just a matter
of a few dollars or so&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was leaving town. Much discussion. No, I
couldn't stay on. Well, if I insisted&mdash;yes, he'd get
my pay envelope. My, oh, my, they missed me!
Why so foolish as to leave New York? Now, as for
my wages, they could easily be fixed to suit....
All right, all right, he'd get my last pay envelope.</p>

<p>And there was my pay envelope with just twelve
dollars again. &#8220;What about my overtime?&#8221;</p>

<p>Overtime? Who said anything about overtime?
He did himself. He'd promised me if I worked every
night that week late I'd get paid for it. Every single
night I had stayed, and where was my pay for it?</p>

<p>He shook his finger at my time card.</p>

<p>Show him one hour of overtime on that card!</p>

<p>I showed him where every night the time clock
registered overtime.</p>

<p>Yes, but not once was it a full hour. And didn't I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
know overtime never counted unless it was at least
a full hour?</p>

<p>No, he had never explained anything about that.
I'd worked each night until everything was done
and I'd been told I could go.</p>

<p>Well, of course he didn't want to rob me. I really
had nothing coming to me. Each night I'd stayed on
till about 6. But they would figure it out and see
what they could pay me. They figured. I waited.
At length majestically he handed out fifty-six cents.</p>


<p class="thought">The fat, older brother in the firm rode down in the
elevator with me&mdash;he who used to move silently
around the factory about four times a day, squinting
out of his beady eyes, such light as shown there
bespeaking 100 per-cent possession. He held his fat
thumbs in the palms of his fat hands and benignly
he was wont to survey his realm. Mine! Mine!
Mine! his every inch of being said. Nor could his
proportion of joy have been greater if he had six
floors of his own to survey, instead of one little claptrap
back room. It did make him so happy. He
wore a kindly and never-changing expression, and he
never spoke.</p>

<p>Going down in the elevator, he edged over to my
corner. He pinched my arm, he pinched my cheeks.
<i>Ach</i>, but he'd miss me bad. Nice girl, I was.</p>

<p>Evidently he, too, had evolved a moral equivalent
for a living wage. Little kindly personal attentions
were his share for anything not adequately covered
by twelve dollars and fifty-six cents.</p>

<h4><i>No. 536 Tickets Pillow Cases</i></h4>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>h</span>, one should write of the bleachery <i>via</i> the
medium of poetry! If the thought of the brassworks
comes in one breath and the bleachery in the
next, the poetry must needs be set to music&mdash;the
Song of the Bleachery. What satisfaction there must
be to an employer who grows rich&mdash;or makes his income,
whatever it may be&mdash;from a business where so
much light-heartedness is worked into the product!
Let those who prefer to sob over woman labor behind
factory prison bars visit our bleachery. Better still,
let them work there. Here at least is one spot where
they can dry their tears. If the day ever dawns when
the conditions in that bleachery can be referred to
as typical of American industrial life, exist the agitator,
the walking delegate, the closed and open shop
fight.</p>

<p>I can hear a bleachery operator grunting, &#8220;My
Gawd! what's the woman ravin' over? Is it <i>our</i>
bleachery she's goin' on about?&#8221; Most of the
workers in the bleachery know no other industrial
experience. In that community, so it seems, a child
is born, attends school up to the minimum required,
or a bit beyond, and then goes to work in the bleachery&mdash;though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a few do find their way instead to the
overall factory, and still fewer to the shirtwaist
factory. No other openings exist at the Falls.</p>

<p>There is more or less talk nowadays about Industrial
Democracy. Some of us believe that the application
of the democratic principle to industry is the
most promising solution to industrial unrest and
inefficiency. The only people who have written
about the idea or discussed it, so far, have been
either theorizers or propagandists from among the
intellectuals, or enthused appliers of the principle,
more or less high up in the business end of the thing.
What does Industrial Democracy mean to the rank
and file working under it? Is it one of those splendid
programs which look epoch-making in spirit, but
never permeates to those very people whom it is
especially designed to affect?</p>

<p>It was to find out what the workers themselves
thought of Industrial Democracy that I boarded a
boat and journeyed seventy miles up the Hudson
to work in the bleachery, where, to the pride of those
responsible, functions the Partnership Plan.</p>

<p>What do the workers think of working under a
scheme of Industrial Democracy?</p>

<p>What do the citizens of the United States think of
living under a scheme of Political Democracy?</p>

<p>The average citizen does not think one way or the
other about it three hundred and sixty-five days in
the year. Even voting days the rank and file of us
do not ponder overlong on democracy <i>versus</i> autocracy.
Indeed, if it could be done silently, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
dead of night, and the newspapers would promise
not to say a word about it, perhaps we might change
to a benevolent autocracy, and if we could silence
all orators, as well as the press, what proportion of
the population would be vitally concerned in the
transition? Sooner or later, of course, alterations in
the way of doing this and that would come about,
the spirit of the nation would change. But through
it all&mdash;autocracy, if it were benevolent, or democracy&mdash;there
would be little conscious concern on the
part of the great majority. Always provided the
press and orators would keep quiet.</p>

<p>From my own experience, the same could be said
of Industrial Democracy. Autocracy, democracy,
the rank and file of the workers, especially the women
workers, understand not, ponder not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; chuckled Mamie, &#8220;I could 'a' died laughin'
once. A fella came through here askin' everybody
what we thought of the Partnership Plan. My
Gawd! when he got to me I jus' told him I didn't
understand the first thing about it. What ud he do
but get out a little book and write what I said down.
Never again! Anybody asks me now what I think
of the Partnership Plan, and I keep my mouth shut,
you bet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once an enthused visitor picked on me to ask what
I thought of working under the Partnership Plan.
After he moved on the girls got the giggles. &#8220;Say,
these folks that come around here forever asking what
we think about the Partnership Plan! Say, what any
of us knows about that could be put in a nutshell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And gray-haired Ella Jane, smartest of all, ten
years folding pillow cases, said: &#8220;I don't know anything
about that Partnership Plan. All I know is
that we get our share of the profits and our bonuses,
and I can't imagine a nicer place to work. They do
make you work for what you get, though. But it's
all white and aboveboard and you know nobody's
trying to put something over on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the general spirit of the place? Could that be
traced to anything else but the special industrial
scheme of things? One fact at least is certain&mdash;the
employing end is spared many a detail of management;
the shift in responsibility is educating many a
worker to the problems of capital. And production
is going up.</p>


<p class="thought">Have you ever tried to find a spare bed in a town
where there seems to be not a spare bed to be had?
I left my belongings in an ice cream store and followed
every clue, with a helpful hint from the one
policeman, or the drug store man, or a fat, soiled
grandmother who turned me down because they
were already sleeping on top of one another in her
house. In between I dropped on a grassy hillside
and watched Our Bleachery baseball team play a
Sunday afternoon game with the Colored Giants.
We won.</p>

<p>And then I took up the hunt again, finally being
guided by the Lord to the abode of the sisters Weston&mdash;two
old maids, combined age one hundred and
forty-nine years, who took boarders. Only there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
were no more to take. The Falls was becoming
civilized. Improvements were being installed in
most of the houses. Boarders, which meant mainly
school-teachers, preferred a house with Improvements.
The abode of the sisters Weston had none. It was
half a company house, with a pump in the kitchen
which drew up brown water of a distressing odor.</p>

<p>The sisters Weston had worked in the overall factory
in their earlier years, hours 7 to 6, wages five
dollars a week, paid every five to six weeks. Later
they tried dressmaking; later still, boarders. I
belonged to the last stage of all&mdash;they no longer
took boarders, they took a boarder. Mr. Welsh
from the electrical department in the bleachery,
whose wife was in Pennsylvania on a visit to her
folks, being sickly and run down, as seemed the wont
of wives at the Falls, took his meals at our boarding
house, when he was awake for them. Every other
week Mr. Welsh worked night shift.</p>

<p>My belongings were installed in the room assigned
me, and the younger of the sisters Weston, seventy-three,
sat stiffly but kindly in a chair. &#8220;Now about
the room rent...?&#8221; she faltered. Goodness! yes!
My relief at finding a place to sleep in after eleven
turn-downs was so great that I had completely neglected
such a little matter as what the room might
cost me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you charge?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you feel you can pay? We want you
should have some money left each week after your
board's paid. What do you make at the bleachery?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>My conscience fidgeted within me a bit at that.
&#8220;I'd rather you charged me just what you think the
room and board are worth to you, not what you think
I can pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we used to get eight dollars a week for
room and board. It's worth that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is cheaper to live than die in the Falls at that
rate. Three hot meals a day I got: breakfast, coffee,
toast, two eggs, mush, later fruit; dinner, often soup,
always meat, potatoes, vegetables, coffee, and a
dessert; supper, what wasn't finished at dinner, and
tea. Always there was plenty of everything. Sometimes
too much, if it were home-canned goods which
had stood too many years on the shelves, due to lack
of boarders to eat the same. But the sisters Weston
meant the best.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d'ya like the punkin pie?&#8221; the older, Miss
Belle, would ask.</p>

<p>The pumpkin pie had seemed to taste a trifle
strange, but we laid it to the fact that it was some
time since we had eaten pumpkin pie. &#8220;It tastes
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there! Glad to hear you say it. Canned
that punkin ourselves. Put it up several years ago.
Thought it smelled and looked a bit spoiled, but I
says, guess I'll cook it up; mebbe the heat 'n' all'll
turn it all right again. There's more in the kitchen!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it suddenly seemed as if I must get to work
earlier that noon than I had expected. &#8220;Can't ya
even finish your pie? I declare I'm scared that pie
won't keep long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Welsh got sick after the first couple of meals,
but bore on bravely, nor did the matter of turned
string beans consciously worry Mr. Welsh. The
sisters themselves were always dying; their faithful
morning reports of the details of what they had been
through the night before left nothing to the imagination.
&#8220;Guess I oughtn't ta 'a' et four hot cakes for
supper when I was so sick yesterday afternoon. I
sure was thinking I'd die in the night.... 'Liza, pass
them baked beans; we gotta git them et up.&#8221;</p>


<p class="thought">At six o'clock in the morning the bleachery whistle
blows three times loud enough to shake the shingles
on the roofs of the one-hundred-year-old houses and
the leaves on the more than one-hundred-year-old
trees about the Falls. Those women who have their
breakfasts to get and houses to straighten up before
they leave for work&mdash;and there are a number&mdash;must
needs be about before then. Seven o'clock sees
folks on all roads leading to the bleachery gate. At
7.10 the last whistle blows; at 7.15 the power is
turned on, wheels revolve, work begins.</p>

<p>It must be realized that factory work, or any other
kind of work, in a small town is a different matter
from work in a large city, if for no other reason than
the transportation problem. Say work in New
York City begins at 7.45. That means for many, if
not most, of the workers, an ordeal of half an hour's
journey in the Subways or &#8220;L,&#8221; shoving, pushing,
jamming, running to catch the shuttle; shoving,
pushing, jamming, running for the East Side Subway;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
shoving, pushing, jamming, scurrying along
hard pavements to the factory door; and at the end
of a day of eight or nine hours' work, all that to be
done over again to get home.</p>

<p>Instead, at the Falls, it meant a five minutes'
leisurely&mdash;unless one overslept&mdash;walk under old
shade trees, through the glen along a path lined with
jack-in-the-pulpits, wild violets, moss&mdash;the same
five minutes' walk home at noon to a hot lunch,
plenty of time in which to eat it, a bit of visiting on
the way back to the factory, and a leisurely five
minutes' walk home in the late afternoon. No one
has measured yet what crowded transportation
takes out of a body in the cities.</p>

<p>New York factories are used to new girls&mdash;they
appear almost daily in such jobs as I have worked in.
At the Falls a strange person in town is excitement
enough, a strange girl at the bleachery practically an
unheard-of thing. New girls appear now and then
to take the places of those who get married or the
old women who must some time or other die. But
not strange girls. Everyone in the bleachery grew
up with everyone else; as Ella Jane said, you know
their mothers and their grandmothers, too.</p>

<p>It so happened that a cataclysmic event had visited
the Falls the week before my appearance. A family
had moved away, thereby detaching a worker from
the bleachery&mdash;the girl who ticketed pillow cases.
The Sunday I appeared in town, incidentally, seven
babies were born. That event&mdash;or those events&mdash;plus
me, minus the family who moved away and an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
old man who had died the week before, made the
population of the Falls 4,202. Roughly, half that
number either worked at the bleachery or depended
on those who worked there. Who or what the other
half were, outside the little group of Main Street
tradespeople, remained a mystery. Of course, there
were the ministers of the gospel and their families&mdash;in
the same generous overdose&mdash;apportioned to most
small towns. The actual number working in the
bleachery was about six hundred and twenty men and
women.</p>

<p>Odd, the different lights in which you can see a
small town. The chances are that, instead of being
a worker, I might have spent the week end visiting
some of the &#8220;<i>&eacute;lite</i>&#8221; of the Falls. In that case we
should have motored sooner or later by the bleachery
gate and past numerous company houses. My host,
with a wave of the hand, would have dispatched the
matter by remarking, &#8220;The town's main industry.
The poor devils live in these houses you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead, one day I found myself wandering along
the street of the well-to-do homes. What in the
world...? Who all ever lived way up here? Whatever
business had they in our Falls? Did they have
anyone to talk to, anything to do? I laid the matter
before Mamie O'Brien.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any rich folk living around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess so. Some swell estates round about&mdash;never
see the people much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they stuck up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno&mdash;na. Saw one of 'em at the military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
funeral last week. She wasn't dressed up a bit swell&mdash;just
wore a plaid skirt. Didn't look like anybody
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, we were the town. It was the
bleachery folk you saw on the streets, in the shops,
at the post office, at the movies. The bleachery
folk, or their kind, I saw at the three church services
I attended. If anyone had dared sympathize with
us&mdash;called us &#8220;poor devils&#8221;!</p>


<p class="thought">The first morning at the bleachery the foreman
led me to the narrow space in the middle of three
large heavy tables placed &#8220;U&#8221; shape, said, &#8220;Here's
a girl to ticket,&#8221; and left me. The foreman knew
who I was. Employment conditions at the bleachery
were such that it was necessary to make sure of a job
by arranging matters ahead of time with the manager.
Also, on a previous occasion I had visited the bleachery,
made more or less of an investigation, and sat
in on a Board of Operatives' meeting. Therefore, I
left off my earrings, bought no Black Jack, did not
feel constrained to say, &#8220;It ain't,&#8221; though saw no
reason why I too should not indulge in &#8220;My Gawd!&#8221;
if I felt like it. I find it one of the most contagious
expressions in the language. The girls did not seem
to know who I was or what I was. Not until the
second day did the girl who stood next to me ask my
name&mdash;a formality gone through within the first five
minutes in any New York job. I answered Cornelia
Parker. She got it Miss Parks, and formally introduced
me around the table&mdash;&#8220;Margaret, meet Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Parks&mdash;Miss White, Miss Parks.&#8221; Also all very
different from New York. About the only questions
asked by any girl were, &#8220;You're from New York?&#8221;
and, &#8220;Where did you work before you came here?&#8221;
Some wondered if I wasn't lonesome without my
folks. I didn't have any folks. There was none of
the expressed curiosity of the New York worker as
to my past, present, and future. Not until the last
few days did I feel forced to volunteer now and then
enough information so that they would get my name
and me more or less clear in their minds and never
feel, after their heart-warming cordiality, that I had
tried &#8220;to put anything over on them.&#8221; Whether I
was Miss Parks or Mrs. Parker, it made no difference
to them. It did to me, for I felt here at last I could
keep up the contacts I had made; and instead of
walking off suddenly, leaving good friends behind
without a word, I could honestly say I was off to the
next job, promise everyone I'd write often and come
again to the Falls, and have everyone promise to
write me and never come to New York without letting
me know. I can lie awake nights and imagine
what fun it is going to be getting back to the Falls
some day and waiting by the bridge down at the
bleachery for the girls to come out at noon, seeing
them all again. Maybe Mrs. Halley will call out
her, &#8220;Hi! look 'ose 'ere!&#8221;</p>


<p class="thought">At our bleachery, be it known, no goods were manufactured.
We took piece goods in the rough, mostly
white, bleached, starched, and finished it, and rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
or folded the finished stuff for market. In Department
10, where most of the girls worked, the west
end of the big third floor, three grades of white goods
were made into sheets and pillow cases, ticketed,
bundled, and boxed for shipping. Along the entire
end of the room next the windows stood the operating
machines, with rows of girls facing one another, all
hemming sheets or making pillow cases. There
were some ten girls who stood at five heavy tables,
rapidly shaking out the hemmed sheets, inspecting
them for blemishes of any kind, folding them for the
mangle, hundreds and hundreds a day. At other
tables workers took the ironed sheets, ticketed them,
tied them in bundles, wrapped and labeled and
stacked the bundles, whereupon they sooner or later
were wheeled off to one side and boxed. Four girls
worked at the big mangle. Besides the mangle, one
girl spent her day hand-ironing such wrinkles as appeared
now and then after the mangle had done its
work.</p>

<p>So much for sheets. There were three girls (the
term &#8220;girl&#8221; is used loosely, since numerous females
in our department will never see fifty again) who
slipped pillow cases over standing frames which
poked out the corners. After they were mangled
they were inspected and folded, ticketed, bundled,
and wrapped at our three U-shaped tables. Also
there, one or two girls spent part time slipping pieces
of dark-blue paper under the hemstitched part of the
pillow cases and sheets, so that the ultimate consumer
might get the full glory of her purchase.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The first week Nancy, a young Italian girl (there
were only two nationalities in the Falls&mdash;Italians
and Americans), and I ticketed pillow cases. At the
end of that time I had become efficient enough so
that I alone kept the bundler busy and Nancy was
put on other work. Ticketing means putting just
the right amount of smelly paste on the back of a
label, slapping it swiftly just above the center of the
hem. There are hundreds of different labels, according
to the size and quality of the pillow cases and the
store which retails them. My best record was ticketing
about six thousand seven hundred in one day.
The cases come folded three times lengthwise, three
times across, sixty in a bundle. As fast as I ticketed
a bundle I shoved them across to the &#8220;bundler,&#8221;
who placed six cases one way, six the other, tied the
bundle of twelve at each end with white tape, stacked
them in layers of three until the pile was as high as
possible for safety, when it was shoved across to the
wrapper. How Margaret's fingers flew! She had
each dozen in its paper, tied and labeled, in the wink
of an eye, almost.</p>

<p>In our department there were three boys who
raced up and down with trucks; one other who
wrapped the sheets when he did not have his arm
gayly around some girl; and the little man to pack
the goods in their shipping boxes and nail them up.
There were two forewomen&mdash;pretty, freckled-faced
Tess and the masculine Winnie. Over all of us was
&#8220;Hap,&#8221; the new boss elected by Department 10 as
its representative on the Board of Operatives. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
safe to say he will be re-elected as long as death or
promotion spare him. Hap is a distinct success.
He never seems to notice anybody or anything&mdash;in
fact, most of the time you wonder where in the
world he is. But on Hap's shoulders rests the output
for our entire department. The previous &#8220;boss&#8221;
was the kind who felt he must have his nose in
everything and his eye on everybody. The month
after Hap and his methods of letting folks alone
came into power, production jumped ahead.</p>

<p>But Hap spoke up when he felt the occasion warranted
it. The mangle girls started quitting at 11.30.
They &#8220;got by&#8221; with it until the matter came to Hap's
notice. He lined the four of them up and, while the
whole room looked on with amused interest, he told
them what was what. After that they stayed till 12.</p>

<p>Another time a piece-rate girl allowed herself to
be overpaid two dollars and said nothing about it.
Hap called her into the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn't you get too much in your envelope this
week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. I 'ain't figured up yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you keep track of your own work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I 'ain't figured up yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring me your card.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl reddened and produced a card with everything
up to date and two dollars below the amount
in her pay envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better take a week off,&#8221; said Hap. But he
repented later in the afternoon and took it back, only
he told her to be more careful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the bundler who took me under her wing
that first day&mdash;pretty Mamie O'Brien&mdash;three generations
in the Falls. There was no talk of vamping,
no discussions of beaus. Everyone told everything
she had done since Saturday noon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Margaret, didjagototha movies Saturday
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Swell, wasn't it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it. I 'ain't ever saw sweller....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seen Edna's baby Sunday. Awful cute. Had
on them pink shoes Amy made it....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, ain't that awful about Mr. Tinney's grandchild
over to Welkville! Only lived three hours....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They're puttin' in the bathtub at Owenses'....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dya know! After they got the bathroom
all papered at Chases' they found they'd made a
mistake and it's all got to be ripped down. Bathtub
won't fit in.&#8221; (&#8220;Improvements&#8221; were one of the
leading topics of conversation day in and day out at
the Falls.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain't that new hat of Jess Tufts a fright? I
'ain't never saw her look worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back and forth it went&mdash;all the small gossip of the
small town where everyone knows everything about
everyone else from start to finish. It was all a bit
too mild for Mamie, as I later learned&mdash;indeed, I
began to learn it that day. It was no time before
Mamie was asking my opinion on every detail of the
Stillman case: Did I think Mrs. Stokes would get
her divorce? Did I consider somebody or other
guilty of some crime or other? Somebody gets the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
electric chair to-morrow? Wasn't it the strangest
thing that somebody's body hadn't been recovered
yet? Whatdyaknow about a father what'll strangle
his own child? A man got drowned after he'd been
married only two days. And did I think Dempsey
or Carpentier would win the fight? &#8220;Gee! Wouldn't
you give your hat to see that fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was nearly drowning myself and the
labels in paste, at the same time trying to appear
intelligent about a lot of things I evidently was most
uninformed about; working up an enthusiasm for
the Dempsey-Carpentier fight which would have led
anyone to believe my sole object in working was to
accumulate enough cash to pay the price of admission.
And all this time I was feasting my eyes on
fresh-faced girls in summer wash dresses, mostly
Americans, some Italians; no rouge whatever; not
a sign of a lipstick, except on one girl; little or no
powder; a large, airy, clean, white room, red-and-white
striped awnings at the windows; and wherever
the eye looked hillsides solid with green trees almost
close enough to touch (the bleachery was built down
in a hollow beside a little river). Oh, it was too good
to be true, after New York!</p>

<p>Pretty gray-haired, pink-cheeked (real genuine
pink-cheeked) Mrs. Hall and I were talking about
the bleachery on our way to work one morning.
Mrs. Hall had been a forelady in a New York private
dressmaking establishment. She had what is called
&#8220;style and personality.&#8221; Her wages in New York
had been thirty-five dollars a week, and she had much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
variety and responsibility, which she loved. Circumstances
brought her to the Falls. She had never
worked in a factory; the very idea had appalled her,
yet she must work. One day she went up to Department
10 to see what it was all like. &#8220;Why,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;it took my breath away! I felt as if I was in
one of those lovely rooms where they did Red Cross
work during the war. Of course I get only a small
amount a week and it's the same thing over and
over again, and after what I was used to in New York
that's hard. But it never seems like I was in a factory,
somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just so. There was never the least &#8220;factory atmosphere&#8221;
about the place. It used to make me
think of a reception, the voice of the machines for
the music, with always, always the sound of much
talk and laughter above the whir. Sometimes&mdash;especially
Mondays, with everyone telling everyone
else what she had done over the week end, and for
some reason or other Fridays, the talk was &#8220;enough
to get you crazy,&#8221; Margaret used to say. &#8220;Sure it
makes my head swim.&#8221; Nor was the laughter the
giggling kind, indulged in when the forelady was not
looking. It was the riotous variety, where at least
one of a group would &#8220;laugh till she most cried&#8221;;
nor did it make the least difference, whether the forelady
was one foot or one hundred away. Like as not
the forelady was laughing with the rest. Only once
did I ever see authority exerted to curb merriment.
On that occasion things reached a climax. All those
not directly concerned with the joke became so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
curious as to what it was all about that one by one
the girls left their machines and gathered up one end
of the room to laugh with the rest, until production,
it was apparent, was at a standstill. Winnie went
out and told Hap. Hap merely stepped inside the
room, and every girl did &#8220;sure get busy.&#8221; It was
the only time even Hap so much as paid the least
attention to what went on. All day there was talk,
all day laughter, all day visiting a bit here and there,
back and forth. Yet in the month of April production
had reached the highest point ever, and the
month I was there was expected to surpass April.
It is significant that with all the fun, the standard
of efficiency and production in our bleachery was
such that out of eighteen like industries in the country,
we were one of the only two running full time.
Thirteen were shut down altogether.</p>

<p>That first day I asked Mamie what time work
began in the morning. Mamie giggled. &#8220;I dunno.
Say, Margaret, what time does work begin in the
morning?&#8221; &#8220;Seven-fifteen, I think.&#8221; Under the
Partnership Plan I knew that each operative was
allowed a week's vacation on full pay. But every
time late, after fifteen times, deducted so many
minutes from the vacation, just as any time off without
sufficient cause meant that much less vacation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been late?&#8221; I asked Mamie.</p>

<p>More giggles. &#8220;Say, Margaret, she wants to know
if I was ever late!&#8221; To me: &#8220;Ninety-seven times
last year&mdash;no vacation at all for mine. Ask Margaret
how many time she's been late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Still more giggles. Margaret giggled, I giggled.
Margaret had been late one hundred eighteen times.
Some of the girls were late practically every day;
they were like small boys who would not for the world
have anyone think they would try to do in school
what was expected of them. Yet there were several
girls who were to come into their full week off&mdash;the
names and dates were posted on the bulletin board;
others were given five days, three days, down to a
few whose allotment out of a possible week was one-half
day. But several of the most boastful over
their past irregular record, and who were receiving
no vacation at all, claimed they were going to be on
time every day this coming year&mdash;&#8220;Sure.&#8221; This
was the first year the vacation with pay had been
granted. I thought of Tessie at the candy factory&mdash;Tessie
who had been sent speedily home by the pop-eyed
man at the door because she was ten minutes
late, due to taking her husband to the hospital.
Verily, there is no &#8220;factory atmosphere&#8221; about the
bleachery, compared with New York standards. The
men, they say, take the whole matter of punctuality
and attendance more seriously than the women.</p>

<p>The second day I began my diary with, &#8220;A bleachery
job is no job at all.&#8221; That again was by contrast.
Also, those first two days were the only two, until the
last week, that we did not work overtime at our table.
When orders pour in and the mangle works every
hour and extra folders are put on and the bundles
of pillow cases pile up, then, no matter with what
speed you manage to slap on those labels, you never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
seem to catch up. Night after night Nancy, Mamie,
Margaret, and I worked overtime. From 7.15 in
the morning till 6 at night is a long day. Then
for sure and certain we did get tired, and indeed
by the end of a week of it we were well-nigh
&#8220;tuckered out.&#8221; But the more orders that came
in the more profits to be divided fifty-fifty between
Capital and Labor.</p>

<p>(The Handbook on the Partnership Plan reads:
&#8220;Our profit sharing is a 50-50 proposition. The
market wage of our industry is paid to Labor and a
minimum of 6% is paid to Capital. After these have
been paid, together with regular operating expenses,
depreciation reserve, taxes, etc., and after the Sinking
Funds have been provided for by setting aside 15%
of the next profits for Labor and 15% for Capital,
the remaining net profits are divided 50% for Capital
and 50% for the operatives, and the latter sum
divided in proportion to the amount of each one's
pay for the period.... A true partnership must
jointly provide for losses as well as for the sharing
of profits.... These Sinking Funds are intended to
guarantee Capital its minimum return of 6% during
periods when this shall not have been carried, and
to provide unemployment insurance for the operatives,
paying half wages when the company is unable
to furnish employment.&#8221;)</p>

<p>In the candy factory back in New York, Ida, the
forelady, would holler from the end of the room, &#8220;My
Gawd! girls, work faster!&#8221; At the bleachery, when
extra effort was needed, the forelady passed a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
around our table from a New York firm, saying their
order must be filled by the end of that week or they
would feel justified in canceling the same. Every
girl read the letter and dug her toes in. No one ever
said, &#8220;You gotta work overtime to-night!&#8221; We just
mutually decided there was nothing else to do about
it, so it was, &#8220;Let's work overtime to-night again.&#8221;
It was time-and-a-half pay for overtime, to be sure,
but it would be safe to assert it was not alone for the
time and a half we worked. We felt we had to catch
up on orders. A few times only, some one by about
four o'clock would call: &#8220;Oh, gee! I'm dead; I've been
workin' like a horse all day. I jus' can't work
overtime to-night.&#8221; The chances were if one girl
had been working like a horse we all had. Such was
the interrelation of jobs at our table.</p>

<p>Except, indeed, Italian Nancy. Whether it was
because Nancy was young, or not overstrong, or not
on piece rates, or a mixture of the three, Nancy never
anguished herself working, either during the day or
overtime. One evening she spent practically the
entire overtime hour, at time and a half, washing
and ironing a collar and cuffs for one of the girls.
Nor did any of our table think it at all amiss.</p>

<p>During the day Nancy was the main little visitor
from our table. She ambled around and brought
back the news. If interesting enough from any
quarter, another of us would betake herself off for
more details. One day Nancy's young eyes were as
big as saucers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, whatdyaknow! That Italian girl Minna,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
she's only fifteen and she's got a gold ring on with a
white stone in it and she says she's engaged!&#8221; We
sent Nancy back for more details. For verification
she brought back the engagement ring itself. &#8220;Whatdyaknow!
Only fifteen!&#8221; (Nancy herself was a
year beyond that mature age.) &#8220;The man she's
goin' to marry is awful old, twenty-five! Whatdyaknow!&#8221;
At a previous time Nancy had regaled our
table with an account of how, out of a sense of duty
to a fellow-countryman, she had announced to this
same Minna that she simply must take a bath.
&#8220;Na,&#8221; said Minna, &#8220;too early yet.&#8221; That was the
end of May.</p>

<p>We were all, even I after the third day, on piecework
at our table, except Nancy. Most of the girls
in Department 10 were on piecework. There was
one union in the bleachery; that was in another
department where mostly men were employed&mdash;the
folders. They worked time rates. With us, as soon
as a girl's record warranted it, she was put on piece
rates. Nancy and most of those young girls were
still, after one or two years, on time rates&mdash;around
eleven dollars a week they made. There was one
case of a girl who did little, day in and day out, but her
hair. She was the one girl who used a lipstick.
They had taken her off time rates and put her on
piecework. She was a machine operator. The last
week I was there her earnings were a little over two
dollars for the week. She was incorrigible. Some of
the machine operators made around thirty dollars a
week. The mangle girls earned around twenty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dollars. Old Mrs. Owens, standing up and inspecting
sheets at the table behind me, made from twenty
dollars to twenty-five dollars. (Mrs. Owens had inspected
sheets for thirteen years. I asked her if she
ever felt she wanted to change and try something
else. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Mrs. Owens; &#8220;a rolling stone
gathers no moss.&#8221;) Mamie, bundler, made around
sixteen dollars; Margaret, at our table, went as
high once as twenty-five dollars, but she averaged
around twenty dollars. My own earnings were
twelve dollars and fifty-three cents the first week,
fifteen dollars and twenty-three cents the second,
eight dollars and twenty-seven cents the third. All
the earnings at our table were low that last week&mdash;Margaret's
were around twelve dollars. For one
thing, there was a holiday. No wonder employers
groan over holidays! The workers begin to slacken
up about two days ahead and it takes two days after
the day off to recover. Then, too, we indulged in too
much nonsense that last week. We laughed more
than we worked, and paid for it. The next week
Mamie and Margaret claimed they were going to
bring their dinners the whole week to work that
noon hour and make up for our evil days. But as
gray-haired Ella Jane said, she laughed so much that
week she claimed she had a stomach ache. &#8220;We'll
be a long time dead, once we die. Why not laugh
when you get a chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why not?&mdash;especially in a small town where it is
well to take each chance for fun and recreation as it
comes&mdash;since goodness knows when the next will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
show itself. Outside of the gayety during working
hours, there was little going on about the Falls.
Movies&mdash;of course, movies. Four times a week the
same people, usually each entire family, conscientiously
change into their best garments and go to
the movie palace. The children and young people
fill the first rows, the grown folk bring up the rear.
Four times a week young and old get fed on society
dramas, problem plays, bathing girl comedies. Next
day it is always:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sadie, did ya saw the show last night? Wasn't
it swell where she recognized her lover just before
he got hung?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just once since movies were has the town been
taken by storm, and that was while I was there. It
was &#8220;The Kid&#8221; that did it. Many that day at the
bleachery said they weren't going&mdash;didn't like Charlie
Chaplin&mdash;common and pie-slinging; cheap; always
all of that. Sweet-faced Mamie, who longs to go
through Sing Sing some day&mdash;&#8220;That's where they
got the biggest criminals ever. Wonder if they let
you see the worst ones&#8221;&mdash;Mamie, who had thrilled
to a trip through the insane asylum; Mamie, who
could discuss for hours the details of how a father
beat his child to death; Mamie, to whom a divorce
was meat and a suicide drink&mdash;Mamie wasn't going
to see Charlie Chaplin. All that pie-slinging stuff
made her sick.</p>

<p>Usually a film shows but once at the Falls. &#8220;The
Kid&#8221; ran Monday matin&eacute;e. Monday night the first
time in history the movie palace was filled and over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
two hundred turned away. Tuesday night it was
shown to a third full house. Everyone was converted.</p>

<p>As for dancing, once a week, Friday nights, there
was a dance at the &#8220;Academy.&#8221; Time was when
Friday night's dance was an event, and the male
contingent from the largest near-by city was wont to
attend. But it cost twenty-four cents to journey by
trolley from the largest near-by city to the Falls,
fifty cents to attend the dance. Unemployment at
the largest near-by city meant that any dancing indulged
in by its citizens was at home, minus car fare.
Also, the music for dancing at the Falls was not favorably
commented upon. So sometimes there were six
couples at the dance, once in a great while twenty.
The youths present were home talent, short on thrills
for the fair ones present.</p>

<p>Indeed, the problem of the Falls was the problem
of every small town&mdash;where in the world could an
up-and-doing girl turn for a beau? The only young
men in the place were those married still younger
and anchored there, or the possessors of too little
gumption to get out. Those left hung over the rail
at the end of the Main Street bridge and eyed every
female passer-by. It was insult heaped on boredom,
from the girls' point of view, that a Falls youth never
so much as tipped his hat when spoken to. &#8220;Paralysis
of the arms is here widespread,&#8221; Bess put it.
&#8220;You oughta see 'em in winter,&#8221; Margaret giggled
one Sunday while four of us were walking the streets
for diversion. &#8220;If you want to know where the gallants
of the Falls are in winter, look for a sunny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
spot. They collect in patches of sun, like some kind
of bugs or animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for reading, &#8220;Do you like to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crazy 'bout readin'.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, books, movie magazines. Don't ever remember
the names of anything. Swell stories. Gee!
I cried and cried over the last one....&#8221;</p>

<p>Or, &#8220;Do much reading?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Na, never git time to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>My old maids never so much as took the newspaper.
They figured that if news was important
enough they'd hear about it sooner or later, and
meanwhile there was much to keep up with at the
Falls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can't hardly sleep nights, got so much on my
mind,&#8221; the seventy-sixer would say.</p>

<p>One night she just got nervous fidgets something
awful, worrying lest her brother might not get to
the Baptist chicken dinner after all, when he'd gone
and paid seventy-five cents for his ticket.</p>

<p>Sunday there was church to attend, the Catholics
flourishing, the Episcopalians next, four other denominations
tottering this way and that. I heard
the Baptist minister preach that every word in the
Bible was inspired by God, ending with a plea for
the family altar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christian brethren, I'm a man who has seen both
sides of life. I could have gone one way. It is by
the grace of God and the family altar that I stand
before you the man I am.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>There were thirty-one people in the congregation
who heard his young though quavering words, eight
of them children, two the organist and her husband,
nine of the remainder women over sixty.</p>

<p>The Methodist, that morning, preached on the
need of a revival at the Falls, and Mr. Welsh, the
electrician, whose wife was resting up in Pennsylvania,
thought he was right. Sunday baseball&mdash;that
day our bleachery team played the Keen
Kutters&mdash;pained Mr. Welsh. The Methodist minister
before this one had been a thorn in the flesh of
his congregation. He frankly believed in amusements,
disgraced them by saying out loud at a union
service that he favored Sunday baseball. Another
minister got up and &#8220;sure made a fool of him,&#8221;
thank goodness. Where was the renegade now?
Called to a church in a large Middle West city where
they have no more sense than to pay him twice what
he was getting at the Falls.</p>

<p>That night I heard a visiting brother at the
Methodist church plead for support for foreign
missions, that we might bring the light of the ideal
Christian civilization under which we live to the
thirsty savages in dark places. He poured his message
to an audience of twenty-one, ten of them gray-haired
women, one a child.</p>

<p>All the ministers prayed long for Harding and
were thankful he was a child of God.</p>

<p>Three of us girls rowed up the lake one night and
cooked our supper and talked about intimate things.
It was a lake worth traveling miles to see. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
one block from the post office. Mamie had been to
the lake twice in all her life. It was good for canoeing,
rowing, fishing, swimming, and, best of all, just
for the eyesight. Yet to the great majority it did not
exist.</p>

<p>The bleachery, through its Partnership Plan, ran
a village club house on Main Street. The younger
boys, allowing only for school hours, worked the
piano player from morn till night. There was a
gymnasium. Suppers were given now and then.
It was supposed to be for the use of the girls certain
days, but they took little or no advantage of it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, and mostly, when the weather permitted,
up and down the street folk sat on their
front porches and rocked or went inside and played
the victrola.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gawd! If I could shake the Falls!&#8221; many a girl
sighed. Yet they had no concrete idea what they
would shake it for. Just before I came the bleachery
girls were called into meeting and it was explained
to them that Bryn Mawr College was planning a
two months' summer school for working girls. Its
attractions and possibilities were laid forth in detail.
It was explained that Vassar College and a woman's
club were making it possible for two bleachery girls
to go, with all expenses paid. Out of 184 eligible
girls four signed up as being interested. One of those
later withdrew her name. The two chosen were
Bess and Margaret, as fine girls as ever went to any
college. There was much excitement the Saturday
morning their telegrams came, announcing Bryn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Mawr had passed favorably upon their candidacy.
Bess especially was beside herself. &#8220;Oh, it's what
I've longed to have a chance to do all my life!&#8221; She
had clutched a <i>New Republic</i> under her arms for
days containing an article about the summer school.
Both Margaret and Bess had spent a couple of years
at West Point during the war as servants, for a
change. They had worked for the colonel's wife
and loved it. &#8220;Gee! the fun we had!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet it was no time before Main Street characteristics
came to the front.</p>

<p>Only four girls had so much as expressed an interest
in the Bryn Mawr scheme. Within a week
after the two girls received the telegrams, tongues
got busy. Margaret looked ready to cry one afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! what's the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Gawd! This place makes you sick. Can't
no one let a person get started enjoyin' themselves
but what they do their best to spoil it for you!&#8221;
Her hands were wrapping pillow case bundles like
lightning, her head bent over her work. &#8220;Don't I
know I ain't nothin' but a factory girl? Don't I
know I probably won't ever be nothin' but one?
Can't a person take a chance to get off for two months
and go to that college without everybody sayin'
you're tryin' to be stuck up and get to be somethin'
grand and think you won't be a factory girl no more?
I don't see anything I'm gettin' out of this that's
goin' to make me anything but just a factory girl
still. I'm not comin' back and put on any airs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
My Gawd! My Gawd! Why can't they leave you
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked two of the Falls men I knew if their sex
would have acted the same as the girls, had it been
two men going off for a two months' treat. &#8220;You
bet,&#8221; they answered. &#8220;It's your darn small-town
jealousy, and not just female at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suppose, then, on top of all the drawbacks of small-town
life, the girls had to work under big-city factory
conditions? At least there was always the laughter,
always the talk, always the visiting back and forth,
at the bleachery.</p>

<p>My last day on the job witnessed a real event.
Katie Martin was to be married in ten days. Therefore,
she must have her tin shower at the bleachery.
Certain traditions of that sort were unavoidable.
At Christmas time the entire Department 10 was
decorated from end to end until it was resplendent.
Such merrymaking as went on, such presents as
were exchanged! And when any girl, American or
Italian, was to be married, the whole department
gave her a tin shower.</p>

<p>Katie Martin inspected and folded sheets. She
was to marry the brother of young Mrs. Annie
Turner, who ticketed sheets. Annie saw to it that
Katie did not get to work promptly that noon.
When she did appear, all out of breath and combing
back her hair (no one ever wore a hat to work), there
on two lines above her table hung the &#8220;shower.&#8221;
The rest of us had been there fifteen minutes, undoing
packages, giggling, commenting. Except old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Mrs. Brown's present. It was her first experience
at a tin shower and she came up to me in great distress.
&#8220;Can't you stop them girls undoin' all her
packages? 'Tain't right. She oughta undo her own.
I jus' won't let 'em touch what I brought!&#8221; Ever
and again a girl would spy Mrs. Brown's contribution.
&#8220;Hey! Here's a package ain't undone.&#8221; &#8220;No,
no, don't you touch it! Ain't to be undone by anybody
but her.&#8221; Poor Mrs. Brown was upset enough
for tears.</p>

<p>There were a few other packages not to be undone
by anybody but her, because their contents were
meant to, and did, cause peals of laughter to the
audience and much embarrassment to Katie. On
the lines hung first an array of baby clothes, all
diminutive size, marked, &#8220;For little Charlie.&#8221; Such
are the traditions. Also hung seven kitchen pans, a
pail, an egg-beater and gem pans; a percolator, a
double boiler and goodness knows what not. On the
table stood six cake tins, more pots and pans, salt
and pepper shakers, enough of kitchenware to start
off two brides. Everybody was pleased and satisfied.
Charlie, the groom-to-be, got a friend with a Ford to
take the shower home.</p>

<p>The last night of all at the Falls I spent at my
second Board of Operatives' meeting, held the first
Friday night of each month. The Board of Operatives
is intended to represent the interests of the
workers in the bleachery. The Board is elected annually
by secret ballot by and from the operatives in the
eleven different departments of the mill. Margaret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and Bess went, too, on request from above, that they
might appear more intelligent should anyone ask at
Bryn Mawr about the Partnership Plan. (&#8220;My
land, what <i>would</i> we tell them?&#8221; they wailed.)
The Board meetings are officially set down as open
to all the operatives, only no one ever heard of anyone
else ever attending. The two girls were &#8220;fussed&#8221;
at the very idea of being present, and dressed in their
best.</p>

<p>The president, elected representative from the
starch room, called the meeting to order from his
position at the head of the table in the Village Club
House. Every member of the Board shaves and puts
on his Sunday clothes, which includes a white collar,
for the Board meeting. It is no free show, either.
They are handed out two dollars apiece for attending,
at the end of the meeting, the same idea as if it were
Wall Street. The secretary reads the minutes of the
Board of Management. (&#8220;The Board of Management
was set up by the Board of Directors in July,
1919, as a result of a request from the Board of Operatives
for more than merely 'advisory' power which
the Board of Operatives then enjoyed in reference to
matters of mill management, wages, working conditions,
etc. The Board of Management consists of
six members, three of whom are the treasurer, the
New York agent, and the local manager, and three of
whom are elected by the Board of Operatives from
their number.... The Board of Management is
authorized to settle and adjust such matters of mill
management as may arise....&#8221;) The Company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
statement, up to March 31, 1921, was read. There
followed a report from the Housing Committee&mdash;first
a financial statement. Then it seemed somebody
wanted to put somebody else out of a house, and
there were many complications indeed arising therefrom,
which took much discussion from everyone and
bitter words. It looked as if it would have to be
taken to court. The conclusion seemed to be that
the Board felt that its executive secretary, chosen
by the management, though paid out of the common
funds, had exceeded his authority in making statements
to tenants. We girls rather shivered at the
acrimony of the discussion. Had they been lady
board members having such a row, half of them would
have been in tears. Next, old Mrs. Owens, who shook
sheets behind me, wanted to buy a certain house on
a certain avenue&mdash;company house, of course. Third,
one Mr. Jones on Academy Street wants us to paper
his kitchen&mdash;he will supply the paper. And there
followed other items regarding paint for this tenant,
new floor for that, should an old company boarding
house be remodeled for a new club house or an
apartment house; it was decided to postpone roofing
a long row of old company houses, etc.</p>

<p>The operative from the folding and packing room
was chairman of the Housing Committee, a strong
union enthusiast. The representative from the
mechanical department reported for the Recreation
and Education Committee; all the night school
classes had closed, with appropriate final exercises,
for the season: the children's playground would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
ready for use July 1st. The man from the &#8220;gray&#8221;
room and singe house reported for the Working Conditions
Committee. Something about watchmen
and a drinking fountain, and wheels and boxes in
the starch room; washing facilities for shovelers;
benches and back stairs.</p>

<p>The Finance Committee reported a deficit on the
mechanical and electrical smoker. Much discussion
as to why a deficit and who ought to pay it, and what
precedent were they setting, and all and all, but it
was ordered paid&mdash;this time. Webster's bills were
too high for papering and painting company houses.
He was a good worker, his plaster and his paper
stuck where they belonged, which hadn't been the
rule before. But it was decided he was too costly
even so, and they were going back to the company
paperers&mdash;perhaps their work would stick better
next time. A report from the Board of Directors was
discussed and voted upon.... The minutes of the
Board of Operatives were posted all through the mill.
Did anyone read them? If so, or if not so, should the
Board of Management minutes also be posted? It
was voted to postpone posting such minutes, though
they were open to any operative, as in the past.</p>

<p>Under Old Business was a long discussion on health
benefits and old-age pensions. For some months
now the bleachery has been concerned on the subject
of old-age pensions. Health benefits have been in
operation for some time. The question was, should
they pay the second week for accident cases, until
the state started its payments the third week?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Under New Business the resignation of the editors
of <i>Bleachery Life</i> was read and accepted. Acrimonious
discussion as to the running of the <i>Bleachery
Life</i>. Again we girls shivered. It was announced a
certain rich man who recently died had left the
Village Club House five hundred dollars&mdash;better
write no letter of thanks until they got the money.
Should the new handbook be printed by union labor
at considerably greater expense, or by an open
shop? Unanimously voted by union labor. More
health-benefit discussions under New Business. It
was voted to increase the Board of Management
by two additional members&mdash;one operative, one
from the employing side. Election then and there
by a secret ballot. The operative from the &#8220;gray&#8221;
room and singe house was elected over the man
from the office force by two votes. Some further
housing discussions, and at 11.15 <small>P.M.</small> the meeting
adjourned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I'm for coming every time.&#8221; Perhaps we
three girls will have started the style of outside
attendance at the meetings.</p>

<p>Whether a wider participation of operatives, a
deeper understanding of Industrial Democracy and
the Partnership Plan, develops or not, certainly
they are a long step on the way to some sort of permeation
of interest. For the next morning early, my
last morning, as I started work, I heard toothless old
Mrs. Holley call over to aged Mrs. Owens, whose
husband even these days is never sober: &#8220;Hi, Mrs.
Owens, what do ye know habout hit! Hain't it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
grand we got out over five million five hundred
thousand yards last month?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say it's grand,&#8221; grinned Mrs. Owens. &#8220;More 'n
a million over what we done month before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi say&mdash;over fifteen million the last three months.
Hi say we're some bleachery, that's what <i>hi</i> say!&#8221;</p>



<h3><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></h3>

<h4><i>No. 1470, &#8220;Pantry Girl&#8221;</i></h4>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">P</span>erhaps</span>, more strictly speaking, instead of
working with the working woman, it was working
with the working man. Hotel work is decidedly co-educational!
Except, indeed, for chambermaids and
laundry workers, where the traditionally female
fields of bed-making and washing have not been
usurped by the male. Even they, those female
chambermaids and launderers, see more or less of
working menfolk during the day. So it might be
thought then that hotel work offers an ideal field
for the growth of such normal intercourse between
the sexes as leads to happy matrimony. No need to
depend on dance halls or the Subway to pick up a
&#8220;fella.&#8221; No need for external administrations from
wholesome social workers whose aim is to enable the
working man or woman to see something of the
opposite sex.</p>

<p>Yet forever are there flies in ointments. Flossie
was one of the salad girls in the main kitchen. Flossie
was Irish, young, most of her teeth gone. Her sister
had worked at our hotel two years earlier, then had
sent for Flossie to come from Ireland. The sister was
now married.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Innocently, interestedly, I asked, &#8220;To a man she
knew here at the hotel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flossie cast a withering eye upon me. &#8220;The good
Lord save us! I should say not! And what decent
girl would ever be marryin' the likes of a man who
worked around a hotel? She couldn't do much worse!
Just steer clear of hotel men, I'm tellin' ya. They're
altogether too wise to be safe for any girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were eating supper. The table of eight all
nodded assent.</p>

<p>Too wise or not too wise&mdash;at least there is a&mdash;cordiality&mdash;a
predisposition toward affection on the
part of male hotel workers which tends to make
one's outside male associates seem fearfully formal,
if not stiffly antagonistic. If one grows accustomed
to being called &#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; &#8220;Darling&#8221; on
first sight, ending in the evening by the time-clock
man's greeting of, &#8220;Here comes my little bunch of
love!&#8221;&mdash;is it not plain that outside in the cruel
world such words as a mere &#8220;How-do-you-do&#8221; or
&#8220;Good morning&#8221; seem cold indeed?</p>

<p>What happens when a girl works three years in
this affectionate atmosphere and then marries a
plumber who hollers merely &#8220;say&#8221; at her?</p>


<p class="thought">Behind the scenes in a hotel&mdash;what is it all about?
To find that out I poked around till the employment-office
entrance of one of New York's biggest and newest
hotels was discovered. There had been no &#8220;ad.&#8221;
in the Sunday paper which would give a hint that any
hotel needed additional help. We took our chances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Some twenty men waited in a little hallway, two
women inside the little office. One of the women
weighed at least two hundred and fifty, the other
not a pound over ninety. Both could have been
grandmothers, both wanted chamber work. The
employment man spied me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything but bein' chambermaid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What experience have you had in hotel work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, but lots in private homes. I'd like a job
around the kitchen some place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever try pantry work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in a hotel, but lots in private families. I
can do that swell!&#8221; (What pantry work meant I
hadn't the least idea&mdash;thought perhaps washing
glasses and silverware.)</p>

<p>He put on his coat and hat and dashed upstairs.
He always put on his coat <i>and</i> hat to go upstairs. In
a few moments he dashed hurriedly back, followed by
another man whose teeth were all worn down in the
front. I learned later that he was an important
steward.</p>

<p>He asked me all over again all the questions the
first man had asked, and many more. He was in
despair and impatient when he found I had not a
single letter of recommendation from a single private
family I had worked for. I could have written myself
an excellent one in a few moments. Could I
bring a letter back later in the day?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Can you fix salads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you could do the job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Sure!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you look as if you could. Never mind the
letter, but get one to have by you&mdash;comes in handy
any job you want. Now about pay&mdash;I can't pay you
what you been used to getting, at least not first
month.&#8221; (I'd mentioned nothing as to wages.)
&#8220;Second month maybe more. First month all I can
pay you is fifty and your meals. That all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>As usual, my joy at landing a job was such that
any old pay was acceptable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be back in two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the employment man called out to the
hall filled with waiting men, &#8220;No jobs for any men
this morning.&#8221; I don't know what became of the
old women.</p>

<p>I was back before my two hours were up, so
anxious to begin. The employment man put on his
hat and coat and dashed upstairs after my steward.
Just incidentally, speaking of hats and coats, it can
be mentioned that all this was in the middle of one
of the hottest summers New York ever knew.</p>

<p>The steward led the way up one flight of iron
stairs and into the main kitchen. Wasn't I all eyes
to see what was what! If anyone is looking for a
bit of muck-raking about the hinterland of restaurants,
let him not bother to read farther. Nothing
could have been cleaner than the kitchen conditions
in our hotel. And orders up and down the line were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to serve <i>nothing</i> which was not absolutely as it
should be.</p>

<p>In a corner of the main kitchen the steward turned
me over to Bridget, who was to take me here, there,
and the other place. By 11.30 <small>A.M.</small>, I was back where
I started from, only, thanks to aged Bridget and her
none-too-sure leadings, I was clad in a white cap and
white all-over apron-dress, and had had my lunch.
Thereupon the steward escorted me to my own
special corner of the world, where, indeed, I was to
be lord of all I surveyed&mdash;provided my gaze fell
not too far afield.</p>

<p>That particular corner was down one short flight
of stairs from the main kitchen into a hustling,
bustling, small and compact, often crowded, place
where were prepared the breakfasts, lunches, and
dinners of such folk who cared more for haste and
less for style than the patrons of the main dining
rooms. Our caf&eacute; fed more persons in a day than the
other dining rooms combined. Outside we could
seat five hundred at a time, sixty-five of those at
marble counters, the rest at small tables. But our
kitchen quarters could have been put in one corner of
the spacious, airy upstairs main kitchen.</p>

<p>Through the bustle of scurrying and ordering
waiters I was led to a small shelved-off compartment.
Here I was to earn my fifty dollars a month
from 1.30 <small>P.M.</small> to 9 <small>P.M.</small> daily except Sunday, with
one-half hour off for supper. I was entitled to eat
my breakfast and lunch at the hotel as well.</p>

<p>This first day, I was instructed to watch for two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hours the girl I was to relieve at 1.30. Her hours were
from 6 in the morning to 1.30, which meant she got the
brunt of the hard work&mdash;all of the breakfast and most
of the lunch rush. To me fell the tail end of the
lunch rush&mdash;up to about 2.15, and supper or dinner,
which only occasionally could be spoken of as &#8220;rush&#8221;
at all. I discovered later that we both got the same
pay, although she had to work very much harder,
and also she had been at our hotel almost two years,
though only nine months at this special pantry job.
Before that she had made toast, and toast only, upstairs
in the main kitchen.</p>

<p>The first question Mary asked me that Monday
morning was, &#8220;You Spanish?&#8221; No, I wasn't. Mary
was a Spanish grass widow. Ten years she had been
married, but only five of that time had she lived
with her husband. Where was he? Back in Spain.
&#8220;No good.&#8221; She had come on to this country because
it was too hard for a woman to make her way
in Spain. She spoke little English, but with that
little she showed that she was kindly disposed and anxious
to help all she could. She herself had a stolid, untidy
efficiency about her, and all the while, poor thing,
suffered with pains in her stomach.</p>

<p>By the time 1.30 came around I knew what I had
to do and could be left to my own devices. To the
pantry girl of our caf&eacute; fell various and sundry
small jobs. But the end and aim of her life had to
be speed.</p>

<p>To the left of my little doorway was a small, deep
sink. Next to the sink was a very large ice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
chest. On the side of the ice chest next the sink hung
the four soft-boiled-egg machines&mdash;those fascinating
contrivances in which one deposited the eggs, set the
notch at two, three, four minutes, according to the
desires of the hurried guest without, sank the cup-shaped
container in the boiling water, and never
gave the matter another thought. At the allotted
moment the eggs were hoisted as if by magic
from out their boilings. Verily are the wonders of
civilization manifold! The sink and the protruding
ice chest filled the entire left side of my small inclosure.
Along the entire right and front was a wide
work-shelf. On this shelf at the right stood the
electric toasting machine which during busy hours
had to be kept going full blast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toast for club!&#8221; a waiter sang out as he sped
by, and zip! the already partially toasted bread
went into the electric oven to be done so crisply and
quickly that you could call out to that waiter, &#8220;Toast
for club&#8221; before he could come back and repeat his
ominous, &#8220;Toast for club!&#8221; at you. People who order
club sandwiches seem always to be in a special hurry.</p>

<p>In the front corner just next the toaster stood the
tray of bread sliced ready to toast, crusts off for dry
or buttered toast, crusts on for &#8220;club,&#8221; very thin
slices for &#8220;toast Melba.&#8221; Directly in front, and next
the bread tray, came the tray filled with little piles of
graham and milk crackers, seven in a pile. What
an amazing number of folk order graham or milk
crackers in a caf&eacute;! It seems unbelievable to one
who has always looked upon a place furnishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
eatables outside a home as a chance to order somewhat
indigestible food prepared entirely differently
from what any home could accomplish. Yet I know
it to be a fact that people seat themselves at a table
or a counter in a more or less stylish caf&eacute; and order
things like prunes or rhubarb and graham or milk
crackers, and perhaps top off, if they forget themselves
so far, with a shredded-wheat biscuit.</p>

<p>It is bad enough if a man feels called upon to act
that way before 2 <small>P.M.</small> When he puts in an order
for such after 6 in the evening&mdash;then indeed it is
a case for tears. I would get the blues wondering
whatever could ail adult humanity that it ordered
shredded-wheat biscuits after dark.</p>

<p>Just above the counter holding the bread and
crackers was the counter on which were placed
the filled orders for the waiters to whisk away. It
was but a step from there to my ice box. The orders
it was my business to fill were for blackberries, blueberries,
prunes, sliced oranges, rhubarb, grapefruit,
whole oranges, apples, sliced peaches and bananas,
muskmelons, and four kinds of cheese. These pretty
well filled the upper half of the ice chest, together
with the finished salads I kept ahead, say three of
each, lettuce and tomato, hearts of lettuce, plain
lettuce, and sliced tomatoes.</p>

<p>In the lower half stood the pitchers of orange and
grape juice, jams and jellies for omelettes to be
made down the line, olives, celery, lettuce, cucumbers,
a small tub of oranges and a large bowl of sliced
lemons. The lemons, lemons, lemons I had daily to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
slice to complete the ice-tea orders! The next pantry-girl
job I fill will be in winter when there is no
demand for ice tea. I had also to keep on hand a
bowl of American cheese cut the proper size to accompany
pie, and together with toast and soft-boiled
eggs and crackers and a crock of French dressing
set in ice. Such was my kingdom, and I ruled it
alone.</p>

<p>During slack hours it was easy, too easy. In rush
hours you had to keep your head. Six waiters might
breeze by in a line not one second apart, each calling
an order, &#8220;Half a cantaloupe!&#8221; &#8220;Two orders of
buttered toast!&#8221; &#8220;Combination salad!&#8221; (that meant
romaine and lettuce leaves, shredded celery, sliced
cucumbers, quartered tomatoes, green pepper, watercress,
which always had to be made up fresh); &#8220;Sliced
peaches!&#8221; (they could never be sliced in advance);
&#8220;One order orange juice!&#8221; &#8220;Toast for club!&#8221; then
how one's fingers sped!</p>

<p>The wonder of it was no one ever seemed to lose
his patience or his temper. That is, nobody out our
way. Maybe in the caf&eacute; there was some millionaire
hastily en route to a game of golf who cursed the
universe in general and the clumsy fingers of some immigrant
pantry girl in particular. (Not so fearfully
clumsy either.)</p>

<p>Between 2 and 2.30 the rush subsided, and that
first day I caught my breath and took time to note
the lay of the land.</p>

<p>My compartment came first, directly next the
dishes. Next me was a beautiful chef with his white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
cap set on at just the chef angle. He was an artist,
with a youngster about fifteen as his assistant.
Some day that youngster will be a more beautiful
chef than his master and more of an artist. His
master, I found out in my slack hours that first
afternoon, was French, with little English at his command,
though six years in this country. I know less
French than he does English, but we got to be good
friends over the low partition which separated us.
There was nothing at all fresh or affectionate about
that French chef. I showed my gratitude for that
by coming over in the afternoon and helping him
slice hot potatoes for potato salad while my floor
got washed. Every day I made him a bow and said,
&#8220;<i>Bon jour, Monsieur le Bon Chef</i>,&#8221; which may be no
French at all. And every day he made me a bow
back and said, &#8220;<i>Bon jour</i>&#8221; something or other, which
I could tell was nice and respectful, but&mdash;I can't write
it down. Monsieur Le Bon Chef made splendid cold
works of art in jellies, and salads which belonged to another
realm than my poor tomatoes and lettuce. Also,
he and his assistant&mdash;the assistant was Spanish&mdash;made
wonder sandwiches. They served jellied soups from
their counter. Poor humble me would fill &#8220;One order
graham crackers, little one!&#8221; But to Monsieur
Le Bon Chef it would be &#8220;Two Cream of Cantaloupes!&#8221;
&#8220;One chicken salad!&#8221; &#8220;One (our hotel)
Plate!&#8221; (What a creation of a little of everything
that was!) Monsieur Le Bon Chef taught me some
tricks of the trade, but this is no treatise on domestic
science.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>I will tell you about Monsieur Le Bon Chef,
though by no means did I learn this all my first
afternoon. I only picked up a little here and there,
now and then. He came to this country a French
immigrant from near Toulouse six or so years ago,
his heart full of dreams as to the opportunities in
America. Likely as not we might now have to add
that, after many searchings, he landed a job peeling
potatoes at fifteen dollars a month. Monsieur Le
Bon Chef was no Bon Chef at all when he landed&mdash;knew
none of the tricks of &#8220;chefness&#8221; to speak of. His
first day in America he sought out an employment
office. Not a word of English could he speak. While
the employment agent was just about to shake his
head and say, &#8220;Nothing to-day,&#8221; a friend, or at
least a countryman, dashed up. &#8220;I have a job for
you,&#8221; said the countryman, and he led my Bon Chef
to New York's most aristocratic hotel. Monsieur
Le Bon Chef could not know there was a cooks'
strike on. Down to the kitchen they led him, and
for some weeks he drew ten dollars a day wages and
his room and board right there at the hotel. To fall
from Toulouse into a ten-dollar-a-day job! And
when one knew scarce more than how to boil potatoes!</p>

<p>Of course, when the strike was over, there were no
such wages paid as ten dollars a day. Nothing like
that was he earning these six years later when he could
make the beauteous works of art in jelly. I asked
him if he liked his work. He shrugged his shoulders
and brushed one side of his rather bristly blond
mustache. &#8220;Na&mdash;no like so much&mdash;nothing in it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
but the moaney&mdash;make good moaney.&#8221; He shrugged
his shoulders again and brushed up the other side of
his mustache. &#8220;No good work just for tha moaney.&#8221;
You see he really is an artist. He was my quiet,
nice friend, Monsieur Le Bon Chef. Indeed, one
night he gave me a wondrously made empty cigar
box with a little lock to it. &#8220;Ooh La-la!&#8221; I cried, and
made a very deep bow, and said in what I'm sure was
correct French&mdash;because Monsieur Le Bon Chef said
it was&mdash;&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>

<p>So then, all there was on our side of the kitchen
was my little compartment and the not quite so
little compartment of Monsieur Le Bon Chef, whose
confines reached around the corner a bit. Around
that corner and back a little way were two fat Porto-Rican
women who washed glasses and spoke no English.
Beyond them, at the right of the stairs going
up to the main kitchen, were clean dishes. They
came on dumb-waiters from some place either above
or below.</p>

<p>At the left of the stairs were some five chefs of as
many nationalities&mdash;Italian, Spanish, South American,
French, Austrian, who filled hot orders, frying and
broiling and roasting. Around the corner and opposite
the Bon Chef and me were first the two cashiers,
then my special friends, the Spanish dessert man
and the Greek coffee and tea man. That is, they were
the main occupants of their long compartment, but
at the time of lunch rush at least six men worked
there. Counting the chore persons of various sorts
and not counting waiters, we had some thirty-eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
working in or for our caf&eacute;&mdash;all men but the two fat
Porto-Rican glass washers and me.</p>

<p>Bridget, the dear old soul, came down that first
afternoon to see how I was getting along. I had
cleaned up spick and span after the Spanish woman&mdash;and
a mess she always managed to leave. The
water was out of the egg-boiling machine and that
all polished; the heat turned off in the toasting
machine and that wiped off; lemons sliced; celery
&#8220;Julietted&#8221;; and I was peeling a tubful of oranges&mdash;in
the way the steward had showed me&mdash;to be sliced by
Spanish Mary for breakfast next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm sure gettin' along swell,&#8221; I told Bridget.</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless ye,&#8221; said my dear old guide, and picked
her way upstairs again.</p>

<p>It was plain to see that down our way everybody's
work eased up between 3.30 and 5. Then
everyone visited about, exchanged newspapers, gossiped
over counters. We changed stewards at three.
Kelly, the easy-going, jovial (except at times) Irishman,
took himself off, and a narrow-shouldered, small,
pernickety German Jew came on for the rest of my
time. When we closed up at nine he went to some
other part of the hotel and stewarded.</p>

<p>My first afternoon Schmitz sauntered about to
see what he could find out. Where did I live, what
did I do evenings, what time did I get up mornings,
what did I do Sundays? One question mark was
Schmitz. One thing only he did not ask me, because
he knew that. He always could tell what nationality
a person was just by looking at him. So? Yes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
he knew first thing what nationality I was. So?
Yes, I was a Turk. But the truth of it was that at
the hotel I was part Irish and part French and part
Portuguese, but all I could talk was the Irish because
my parents had both died while I was very young.
Another day, my Greek friend, the coffee man, said
he was sure there was a little Greek in me; and an
Austrian waiter guessed right away I was a bit
Austrian; and every Spaniard in the kitchen&mdash;and
the hotel was full of them&mdash;started by talking a mile-a-minute
Spanish at me. So a cosmopolitan, nondescript,
melting-pot face is an asset in the labor
world in our fair land&mdash;all nationalities feel friendly
because they think you are a countryman. But a
Turk&mdash;that stretched boundaries a bit.</p>

<p>For every question Schmitz asked me I asked him
one back. His wife and daughter, sixteen, were in
France for three months, visiting the wife's parents.
As Schmitz's pernicketyness became during the next
days more and more impossible to ignore, I solaced
my harassed feelings with the thought of how
much it must mean to Mrs. Schmitz to be away
from Mr. Schmitz and his temperament and disposition
for three blessed months. Perhaps the daughter,
sixteen, had spoken of that phase of the trip to Mrs.
Schmitz. Mrs. Schmitz, being a dutiful wife who has
stood Mr. Schmitz at least, we surmise, some seventeen
years, replied to such comments of her sixteen-year-old
daughter, &#8220;Hush, Freda!&#8221;</p>

<p>At five minutes to five Schmitz graciously told me
I might go up to my supper, though the law in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
statute books stood five. Everybody upstairs in the
main kitchen, as I made my way to the service elevator,
spoke kindly and asked in the accents of at
least ten different nationalities how I liked my job.
Hotel folk, male and female, are indeed a friendly
lot.</p>

<p>The dining room for the help is on the ballroom
floor, which is a short flight of steps above the third. It
is the third floor which is called the service floor, where
our lockers are, and the chambermaids' sleeping
quarters, and the recreation room.</p>

<p>There are, it seems, class distinctions among hotel
help. The chefs eat in a dining room of their own.
Then, apparently next in line, came our dining room.
I, as pantry girl, ranked a &#8220;second officer.&#8221; We
had round tables seating from eight to ten at a
table, table cloths and cafeteria style of getting one's
food. The chefs were waited upon. In our dining
room ate the bell boys, parlor maids, laundry
workers, seamstresses, housekeepers, hotel guards
and police, the employment man, pantry girls&mdash;a bit
of everything. To reach our dining room we had to
pass through the large room where the chambermaids
ate. They had long bare tables, no cloths, and sat
at benches without backs.</p>

<p>As to food, our dining room but reflected the state
of mind any and every hotel dining room reflects,
from the most begilded and bemirrored down. Some
thought the food good, some thought it awful, some
thought nothing about it at all, but just sat and ate.
One thing at least was certain&mdash;there was enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
For dinner there was always soup, two kinds of meat,
potatoes, vegetables, dessert, ice tea, milk, or coffee.
For supper there was soup again, meat or fish, potatoes,
a salad, and dessert, and the same variety of
drinkables to choose from. Once I was late at lunch
and ate with the help's help. The woman who dished
up the vegetables was in a fearful humor that day.
People had been complaining about the food. &#8220;They
make me sick!&#8221; she grunted. &#8220;They jus' oughta
try the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel. I worked in their help's dinin'
room for four years and we hardly ever seen a piece
of meat, and as for eggs&mdash;I'm tellin' ya a girl was
lucky if she seen a egg them four years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The people in our dining room were like the people
in every dining room: some were sociable and talked
to their neighbors, some were not sociable at all.
There was no regular way of seating. Some
meals you found yourself at a table where all was
laughter and conversation. The next meal, among
the same number of people, not one word would be
spoken. &#8220;Pass the salt&#8221; would grow to sound warm
and chummy.</p>

<p>Half an hour was the time allowed everyone for
meals. With a friendly crowd at the table that half
hour flew. Otherwise, there was no way of using up
half an hour just eating. And then what?</p>

<p>After a couple of days, some one mentioned the
recreation room. Indeed, what's in a name? Chairs
were there, two or three settees, a piano, a victrola,
a Christy picture, a map of South America, the dying
soldier's prayer, and three different sad and colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
pictures of Christ. Under one of these was pinned
a slip of paper, and in homemade printing the worthy
admonition:</p>

<p>&#8220;No cursing no stealing when tempted look on his
kindly face.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were all these things, but no girls. Once in a
while a forlorn bunch of age would sit humped in a
chair, now and then a victrola record sang forth its worn
contents, twice the piano was heard. After some ten
days my large fat friend from the help's pantry informed
me that she and I weren't supposed to be there&mdash;the
recreation room was only for chambermaids
and like as not any day we'd find the door locked.
Sure enough, my last day at the hotel I sneaked
around in the middle of the afternoon, as usual, to
see what gossip I could pick up, and the door was
locked. But I made the recreation room pay for
itself as far as I was concerned. Every day I managed
to pick up choice morsels of gossip there that
was grist to my mill.</p>

<p>After my first supper I could find nothing to do or
no one to talk to, so back I went to work&mdash;feeling
a good deal like teacher's pet. About four o'clock it
was my business to tell Schmitz what supplies we were
out of and what and how much we'd need for supper.
When I got back from supper there were always trays
of food to be put in the ice chest, salads to be fixed,
blackberries to dish out, celery to wash, and the like.
By the time that was done supper was on in our caf&eacute;.
That is, for some it was supper; for others, judging
by the looks of the trays which passed hurriedly by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
my compartment, stopping only long enough for
sliced lemon for the ice tea, it was surely dinner.
Dinner <i>de luxe</i> now and then! Such delectable
dishes! How did anybody ever know their names
enough to order them?</p>

<p>From 6 to 7.30 was the height of the supper rush.
What a variable thing our patrons made of it! Some
evenings there would be a regular run on celery
salads, then for four nights not a single order. Camembert
cheese would reign supreme three nights in
succession&mdash;not another order for the rest of the
week. Sometimes it seemed as if the whole of creation
sat without, panting for sliced tomatoes. The
next night stocked up in advance so as to keep no
one waiting&mdash;not a human being looked at a tomato.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock only stragglers remained to be
fed, and my job was to clear out the ice chest of all
but two of each dish, send it upstairs to the main
kitchen, and then start scrubbing house. Schmitz let
it be known that one of the failings of her whose place I
was now filling, the one who was asked to leave the Friday
night before the Monday morning I appeared, was
that she was not clean enough. At first, a year and
a half ago, she was cleanly and upright&mdash;that is, he
spoke of such uprightness as invariably follows
cleanliness. But as time wore on her habits of
cleanliness wore off, and there were undoubtedly
corners in the ice box where her waning-in-enthusiasm
fingers failed to reach. But on a night when
the New York thermometer ranges up toward the
nineties it is a pure and unadulterated joy to labor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
inside an ice box. I scrubbed and rinsed and wiped
until Schmitz almost looked approving. Only it was
congenital with Schmitz that he never really showed
approval of anything or anybody. Schmitz was the
kind (poor Mrs. Schmitz with her three months only
of freedom) who always had to change everything
just a little. There would echo down the line an
order, &#8220;One Swiss cheese, little one&#8221; (that referred
to me, not the cheese). Schmitz would stroll over
from where he was trying to keep busy watching
everyone at once, enter the very confines of my compartment,
and stand over me while I sliced that
Swiss cheese. It was always either too big, in which
case he took the knife from my hands and sliced off
one-sixteenth of an inch on one end; or too small,
in which case Schmitz would endeavor to slice a new
piece altogether. The chances were it would end in
being even smaller than the slice I cut. In that case,
Schmitz would say, &#8220;Led it go, anyway.&#8221; And then,
because he would always be very fair, he stood and
explained at length why the piece was too big, if it
were too big, or too small, if too small. &#8220;You know,
it's dis vay&mdash;&#8221; My Gawd! not once, but every night.
There was always one slice too many or too few on
the sliced-tomato order. Schmitz would say, &#8220;There
must be five slices.&#8221; The next time I put on five
slices Schmitz stuck that nose of his around the
waiter's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, vhat's dat? Only five slices? De guests
won't stand for dat, you know. Dey pay good
money here. Put anoder slice on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I was wont to get fearfully exasperated at times.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I remonstrated, &#8220;last time I had on six and
you told me to put on five!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, but I expect you to use your common
sense!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was his invariable comeback. And always
followed by his patient:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, it's dis vay&mdash;If you put on too much
the hotel, vhy, dey lose money, and of course you
see it's dis vay: naturally&#8221; (that was a pet word of
Schmitz's), &#8220;naturally the hotel don't vant to lose
money&mdash;you can see dat for yourself. Now on the
odder hand if you don't put on enough, vhy of
course you see it's dis vay, naturally a guest vants
to get his money's vorth, you can see dat for yourself&mdash;you've
just got to use your common sense, you
can see dat for yourself.&#8221; Not once, but day after
day, night after night. Poor, poor Mrs. Schmitz!
Verily there are worse things than first-degree murder
and intoxication.</p>

<p>But for all that Schmitz deigned not to allow it to
be known that my scrubbings found favor in his
sight, my own soul approved of me. The shelves
and the sink I scrubbed. Then every perishable
article in my ice chest or elsewhere got placed upon
trays to go upstairs. By this time it was two minutes
to nine. Schmitz, always with his hands clasped
behind him, except when he was doing over everything
I did, said, &#8220;You can go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upstairs among the lockers on the third floor the
temperature was like that of a live volcano,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
only nothing showed any signs of exploding. Fat
women who could speak little or no English were
here and there puffily dismantling, exchanging the
hotel work-uniform for street garments. Everyone
was kindly and affectionate. One old Irishwoman
came up while I was changing my clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dearie, and how did it go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it went swell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's good. The Lord bless ye. But there's
one bit of advice I must be giving ye. There's one
thing you must take care of now. I'm tellin' ye,
dearie, you must guard your personality! I'm tellin' ye,
there 're the men y' know, but guard y' personality!&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked her from the bottom of my heart and
said I'd guard it, surest thing she knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the good Lord and the Virgin Mary bless ye,
child!&#8221; And she patted me affectionately on the
back.</p>

<p>Indeed, I had been getting affectionate pats most
of the time, though the majority of them were from
the male help. The composite impression of that first
day as I took my way home on the sticky Subway was
that the world was a very affectionate place, nor was
I quite sure just what to do about it.</p>

<p>The second morning I was given a glimpse of what
can be done about it. As I was waiting for the elevator
on the service floor to be taken down to work,
a very attractive girl came along and immediately
we became chummy. She had been at the hotel
three weeks; her job was to cut fruit. Had she done
this sort of work long? Not in this country, but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Europe. Just one year had she been in America.
At that moment two youths passed. I saw nothing,
but quick as a flash my new friend flared up, &#8220;You
fresh guy&mdash;keep your hands to yourself!&#8221; So
evidently that's the way it's done. I practiced it
mentally. &#8220;Lots o' fresh guys round here,&#8221; I sniffed.
&#8220;You said it,&#8221; muttered the still ruffled fruit cutter.</p>

<p>Downstairs, Kelly was waiting with a welcoming
nod&mdash;Kelly, the unpernickety steward. Everyone
was as friendly as if we had been feeding humanity
side by side these many years. During the rush
the waiters called out as they sped by: &#8220;Hi there,
little one!&#8221; &#8220;There's the girlie!&#8221; &#8220;Ah there, sweetheart!&#8221;
Verily the world is an affectionate place.
If a waiter had an order to give he passed the time
of day as he gave it and as he collected his order.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how's the little girl to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiptop&mdash;and yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little low in spirits I was to-day until I seen
you'd come&mdash;an' then. You love me as much as you
did yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Move on there. W'at y' a-doin' talkin' to my girl!
Now, honey, I'm tellin' you this here guy is too fresh
for any lady. I'd like one order of romaine lettuce,
bless your sweet heart, if it won't be tirin' your
fingers too much. That's the dearie&mdash;I'm back in a
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Across the way, arms resting on the counter, head
ducked under the upper shelf, leaned a burly redheaded
helper to the Greek.</p>

<p>Every time the pantry girl looked his way he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
beamed and nodded and nodded and beamed. &#8220;How
you lak?&#8221; &#8220;Fine!&#8221; More beams and nods. Soon
a waiter slipped a glass of ice coffee, rich in cream and
sugar, under my counter. Beams and nods fit to
burst from the assistant coffee man across the way.
Beams and nods from the pantry girl. Thus every
day. Our sole conversation was, &#8220;How you lak?&#8221;
&#8220;Fine!&#8221; He said the rest with coffee.</p>

<p>With the lunch rush over, Kelly sneaked around
my entrance and jerked his head sidewise. That
meant, naturally, that I was to approach and harken
unto what he had to say. When Kelly imparted
secrets&mdash;and much of what Kelly had to impart was
that sort of information where he felt called upon to
gaze about furtively to make sure no one was over-hearing&mdash;when
he had matters of weight then to impart
he talked down in his boots and a bit out of the
corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, kid&#8221;&mdash;Kelly jerked his head&mdash;&#8220;want to
tell you about this eatin' business. Y'know, ain't
no one supposed to eat nothin' on this floor. If the
boss catches ya, it's good-by dolly. Sign up over the
door sayin' you'll be dismissed <i>at once</i> if you eat
anything&mdash;see? But I'm givin' ya a little tip&mdash;see?
I don't care how much ya eat&mdash;it's nothin' to me. I
say eat all ya got a mind to. Only for Gawd's sake
don't let the Big Boss catch ya.&#8221; (The Big Boss was
the little chief steward, who drew down a fabulous
salary and had the whole place scared to death.)
&#8220;See&mdash;pull a cracker box out so and put what ya got
to eat behind it this way, then ya can sit down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
sorta take your time at it. If the boss does come
by&mdash;it's behind the cracker box and you should
worry! Have a cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was full up of coffee from my gentleman friend
across the way, so declined Kelly's assistance in
obtaining more. Every day, about 2.30, Kelly got
in a certain more or less secluded corner of my
compartment and ate a bit himself. &#8220;Been almost
fired a couple of times for doin' this&mdash;this place is
full o' squealers&mdash;gotta watch out all the time. Hell
of a life I say when a fella has to sneak around to eat
a bit of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>That second afternoon, Kelly stopped in the
middle of a gulp of coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, w'at t' hell's a girl like you workin' for, anyhow?
Say, don't you know you could get married
easy as&mdash;my Gawd! too easy. Say, you could pick
up with one of these waiters just like that! They're
good steady fellas, make decent pay. You could do
much worse than marry a waiter. I'm tellin' ya
there's no sense to a girl like you workin'.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was an obsession with Kelly. He drilled it
into me daily. Kelly himself was a settled married
man. Of his state we talked often. I asked Kelly
the very first day if he ever went to Coney Island.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ustta&mdash;'ain't been for ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not for ten years?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly looked at me out of the corner of his eyes.
&#8220;Got married ten years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and w'at of it? Don't you have no more
fun?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it! I'm tellin' ya there's no more fun.
Gee! I sure don't know myself these ten years. I
was the kind of a fella&#8221;&mdash;here Kelly was moved in
sheer admiration to do a bit of heavy cursing&mdash;&#8220;I
was the kind of fella that did everything&mdash;I'm tellin'
ya, <i>everything</i>. Bet there ain't a thing in this world I
'ain't done at least once, and most of 'em a whole
lot more 'n that. An' now&mdash;look at me now! Get
up at four every mornin', but Sundays, get down
here at six&#8221; (Kelly was a suburbanite), &#8220;work till
three, git home, monkey with my tools a bit or play
with the kids, eat dinner, sit around a spell, go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long pause. &#8220;Ain't that a hell of a life, I'm
askin' ya?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause in which Kelly mentally reviewed
his glowing past. He shook his head and smiled a
sad smile. &#8220;If you could 'a' seen me ten years ago!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly told me the story of his life more or less in
detail some days later. I say advisedly &#8220;more or
less.&#8221; Considering the reputation he had given himself,
I am relieved to be able to note that he must
have left some bits out, though goodness knows he
put enough in. But Kelly's matrimonial romance
must be told.</p>

<p>Kelly went with a peach of a girl in the years gone
by&mdash;swellest little kid&mdash;gee! he respected that girl&mdash;never
laid hands on her. She wanted to go back to
the old country for a visit, so he paid her way there
and back&mdash;one hundred and sixty-five dollars it had
cost him. Coming home from a ball where Kelly
had been manager&mdash;this at 4 <small>A.M.</small>&mdash;a remark of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
girl's led Kelly to suspect she was not the stainless
bit of perfection his love had pictured. So after
three years of constant devotion Kelly felt that he
had been sold out. He turned around and said then
and there to his fair one, &#8220;You go to hell!&#8221; He never
laid eyes on her again.</p>

<p>A few years later Kelly met an American girl. He
went with her three years, was making seventy-five
dollars a month, had saved eight hundred and
seventy-six dollars, and in addition possessed one
hundred and ten dollars in life insurance. So he
asked the lady to marry him. Y' know w'at she
said to Kelly? Kelly leaned his shaggy mop of
hair my way. She said, &#8220;I won't marry nobody on
seventy-five dollars a month!&#8221; Again Kelly's manhood
asserted itself. Do you know w'at Kelly said
to her? He says, says he, once more, &#8220;You go to
hell!&#8221; He quit.</p>

<p>Whereupon Kelly drew out every cent he possessed
and sailed for Europe. When he landed again in
New York City, d' y'know how much money Kelly
had in his pocket? Thirty-five cents. Then he went
West for seven or eight years, and tore up the
country considerable, Kelly did. He came back to
New York again, again minus cash. A few days
after his return the girl of eight years before met him
by appointment at the Grand Central Station.
What d' y'know? She asked Kelly to marry her&mdash;just
like that. Heck! by that time Kelly didn't
give a darn one way or the other. She bought the
ring, she hired the minister, she did the whole business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Kelly married her&mdash;that's the wife he's got
right now.</p>

<p>One of Kelly's steady, dependable waiters approached
about 5 <small>P.M.</small> &#8220;Say, girl, I like you!&#8221; Of
course, the comeback for that now, as always, was,
&#8220;Aw go-an!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I like you. Say, how about goin' out this
evening with me? We'll sure do the old town!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you sound like as if you got all of twenty-five
cents in your pocket!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned way over my counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got twenty-five dollars, and it's yours any time
you say the word!&#8221;</p>

<p>It's words like that which sometimes don't get said.</p>

<p>For supper that night I sat at a table with a housekeeper,
a parlor maid, and a seamstress, and listened
to much talk. Mainly, it was a discussion of where
the most desirable jobs were to be had in their respective
lines. There was complete unanimity of
opinion. Clubs headed the list, and the cream of
cream were men's clubs. The housekeeper and parlor
maid together painted a picture which would lead
one to conclude that the happiest women in all New
York City were the housekeepers in men's clubs.
The work was light, they were well treated&mdash;it was
a job for anyone to strive for. The type of men or
women in clubs, they remarked, was ahead of what
you'd draw in any hotel.</p>

<p>The parlor maid, an attractive, gray-haired woman&mdash;indeed,
all three were gray-haired&mdash;was very
pleased with her job at our hotel. She slept there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and loved it. The rooms were so clean&mdash;your towels
were changed daily just as for the guests. Sure
she was very contented. If her mother were only
alive&mdash;she died two years ago&mdash;she'd be the happiest
woman in the world, she just knew it. But every
single morning she woke up with an empty feeling
in her heart for the longings after her mother.</p>


<p class="thought">My diary of Thursday of that first week starts:
&#8220;The best day since I've been trying jobs&mdash;Glory
be, it was rich!&#8221; And pages follow as to the wonders
of that one day&mdash;wonders to me, who was after what
the workers themselves think about the universe in
general.</p>

<p>When I found how hard the Spanish woman I
relieved at 1.30 had to work, how much more
rushed she was from 6 to 1.30 than ever I
was from 1.30 to 9, and when I learned, in addition,
that she received no more pay for all her
extra labors, I told her I would come early every
day and help her during the rush. This is all good
psychology and I give it for what it is worth. The
first few days, this Thursday being one of them, she
was very grateful&mdash;spoke often of how much it
helped to have me there early. My last morning
during my two weeks of the hotel job I was so
rushed with final errands to do before leaving New
York that it was impossible for me to arrive at
work before 1.30, my regular and appointed time.
The Spanish woman knew it was my last day. But
she was so put out to think I had not arrived early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that she whisked out of that compartment the second
I arrived, only taking time to give me one fearful
and unmistakable glare. Kelly caught the remnants
of it as she swung by him. He sauntered over to
my counter. &#8220;Say, the nerve of some people!&#8221;</p>

<p>That Thursday noon, I ate with the workers in the
help's kitchen. So much talk! First there was a
row on fit to rend the rafters. One of the Irish girls
plumped herself down to eat and raved on about
Lizzie, an Armenian girl, and something or other
Lizzie had done or hadn't done with the silverware.
Everyone was frank as to what each thought about
Lizzie. Armenian stock was very low that day.
Just then Lizzie appeared, a very attractive, neat
girl who had been friendly and kind to me. I had no
idea it was she about whose character such blusterous
words were being spoken. With Lizzie and the Irish
girl face to face&mdash;Heaven help us! I expected to see
them at each other's throats. Such talk! Finally
another Irish girl turned to the Armenian. &#8220;Why
t'hell do you get so mad over it all, now?&#8221; Lizzie
stopped, gave the second Irish girl a quizzical look.
Slowly a smile spread over her face. She gave a
little chuckle. &#8220;Ho! Why t'hell?&#8221; We all laughed
and laughed, and the fight was off.</p>

<p>It seems Lizzie was known far and wide for her
temper. She had been fired from waiting on the
chefs because she let it loose in their dining room one
night. Now they were trying her out up at our end of
the service floor. Minnie, the oldest Irish woman at
our table and in a decidedly ruffled mood that day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
claimed it was the Armenian in her. &#8220;They're all
like that. Shure, I got a Armenian helper&mdash;that kid
over there. Wait till he says one word more to me.
I'll bust a plate on his head and kick his prostrate
form into the gutter. It'll be a happy day in my
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all asked me about my work and how I
liked it. Evidently mine was a job high in favor.
&#8220;Shure you're left alone and no one to be under
your feet or botherin' with y' every minute of the
day. You're yo'r own boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The talk got around to the strike at the Hotel
McAlpin of a few years ago. It was for more pay.
The strike was lost. I asked why. &#8220;Shure, they
deserved to lose it. Nobody hung together.&#8221;</p>

<p>We discussed domestic service. Every day at that
hotel I wondered why any girl took work in a private
home if she could possibly get a hotel job. Here was
what could be considered by comparison with other
jobs, good pay, plus three nourishing meals a day,
decent hours, and before and after those hours freedom.
In many cases, also, it meant a place to sleep.
There was a chance for talk and companionship with
one's kind during the day. Every chance I got I
asked a girl if she liked working in a private home,
or would change her hotel job if she got a chance.
The only person who was not loud in decrying private
service was Minnie during this special Thursday
lunch. But Minnie was so sore on the world
that day. I do believe she would have objected to
the Virgin Mary, had the subject come up. Minnie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
had worked years in private families and only six
years in hotels. She wished she'd never seen the
inside of a hotel.</p>

<p>That same night at the supper table the subject
came up again before an entirely different crowd. Three
at the table had tried domestic service. Never again!
Why? Always the answer was the same. &#8220;Aw, it's
the feeling of freedom ya never get there, and ya do
get it in a hotel.&#8221; One sweet gray-haired woman
told of how she had worked some years as cook in a
swell family where they kept lots of servants. She
got grand wages, and na&iuml;vely she added, you get a
chance to make lots on the side, o' course. I asked
her if she meant tips from guests. Oh no! She
meant what you made off tradespeople. Don't you
see, if you got the butcher bill up so high, you got
so much off the butcher, and the same with the
grocer and the rest. She had a sister not cooking
long who made over one hundred dollars a month,
counting what she got off tradespeople. It is a perfectly
accepted way of doing, mentioned with no
concern.</p>

<p>But on the whole, that supper table agreed that
domestic service was a good deal like matrimony.
If you got a good family, all right; but how many
good families were there in the world? One woman
spoke of working where they'd made a door mat
of her. Barely did she have food enough to eat.
There were four in the family. When they had
chops the lady of the house ordered just four, which
meant she who cooked the chops got none.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>After lunch this full Thursday I rushed to assist
Mary. I loved going down the stairs into our hot
scurry of excitement. Indeed, it was seeing
behind the scenes. And always the friendly nods
from everyone, even though the waiters especially
looked ready to expire in pools of perspiration. At
Monsieur Le Bon Chef's counter some sticky waiter
had ordered a roast-beef sandwich. The heat had
made him skeptical. &#8220;Call that beef?&#8221; The
waiter next him glared at him with a chuckle.
&#8220;An' must we then always lead in the cow for
you to see?&#8221; A large Irishman breezed up to
my Bon Chef. &#8220;Two beef &agrave; la modes. Make it
snappy, chief. Party's in a hurry. Has to catch
the five-thirty train&#8221;&mdash;this at one o'clock. Everyone
good-natured, and the perspiration literally
rolling off them.</p>

<p>Most of the waiters were Irish. One of them was
a regular dude&mdash;such immaculateness never was.
He was the funny man of the place, and showed off
for my special benefit, for I made no bones of the
fact that he amused me highly. He was a very chippy-looking
waiter&mdash;pug nose, long upper lip. When he
ordered ice coffee he sneaked up on the Greek &agrave; la
Bill Hart, ready to pull a gun on him. He had two
names at his disposal and used one or the other with
every order, no matter who the chef was. In a very
deep tone of voice, it was either, &#8220;James, custard
pie!&#8221; or, &#8220;Dinsmore, one veal cutlet.&#8221; But to
me it was always: &#8220;Ah there, little one! Toast, I
say <i>toast</i>. Dry, little one. Ah yes! There be them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
who out of force of habit inflicted upon them take
even their toast dry. You get me, little one?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was especially immaculate this Thursday.
I guessed he must be taking at least three ladies out
that evening. He looked at me out of the corner of
his eyes. &#8220;<i>Three</i>, little one, this hot night? Winter
time, yes, a man can stand a crowd about him, but
not to-night. No. To-night, little one, I take but
one lady. It allows for more circulation of air.
And you will be that One?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Greek this hot Thursday became especially
friendly. He twirled his heavy black mustache and
carried on an animated broken-English conversation
most of the afternoon. Incidentally, he sent
over one ice coffee with thick cream and two frosted
chocolates.</p>

<p>The little Spaniard next to him, he who served
pies and ice cream and more amazing desserts&mdash;he,
too, became very friendly. There was nothing the
least fresh about the little Spaniard. He mostly
leaned on his counter, in moments of lull in trade,
and when I so much as looked his way, he sighed
heavily. Finally he made bold to converse. I
learned that he had been two years in this country,
eight months at his present job. When I asked him
how he spent his off time, he replied in his very
broken English that he knew nobody and went nowhere.
&#8220;It is no pleasure to go alone.&#8221; He rooms
with an American family on the East Side. They are
very nice. For some years he had been in the printing
trade in South America; there was something to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
job like that. But in New York he did not know
enough English to be a printer, and so, somehow, he
found himself dishing pies and ice cream at our hotel.</p>

<p>Later on that day he asked me, &#8220;Why are you so
happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed I was very cheerful and made no secret of
it. I had sung every song I knew and then whistled
them all as I worked. But Schmitz, who surely had
never smiled in all his life, could stand it no longer.
&#8220;You better not make so much noise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
see, it's dis vay&mdash;&#8221; Poor Schmitz, he had a miserable
time of it that afternoon. For my expressions
of contentment with the world had spread. Unconsciously
a chef would whistle a bit here as he
mixed his gravy ingredients, another there as he
minced chicken, yet another in still another direction
as he arranged a bowl of vegetables. Schmitz's head
swirled first in one direction, then in another. Aching
he was to reduce the universe to his perpetual state
of gloom. But chefs he stood in awe of. He
dared silence only me, and every so often I forgot.</p>

<p>So the Spaniard asked me why I was so happy.
I had no reason. Only a great multitude of reasons
why there was no excuse to be anything else, but I
did not go into that. He would know, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221; I laughed at him, &#8220;rode home on the top
of a bus!&#8221;</p>

<p>A bit later a piece of folded paper landed almost in
my French dressing. It was a note from the Spaniard:
&#8220;Will you go riding with me to-night?&#8221; I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wrote on the bottom of the paper: &#8220;Not to-night.
Perhaps next week, yes?&#8221; A few moments later a
folded menu landed on the floor. On the back was
written: &#8220;I will be very pleased whenever you can or
wish. Could it be Sunday? I hope you wouldn't
take it amiss my asking you this. Frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>I really wanted to take that bus ride with Frank.
It still worries me that I did not. He was such a
lonesome person.</p>

<p>Then there was the tall, lean, dark Irish waiter I
called Mr. O'Sullivan. He was a continual joy to
my heart and gave me cause for many a chuckle.
A rebel, was Mr. O'Sullivan. I heard Kelly call him
down twice for growling at what he considered inexcusable
desires in the matter of food or service on
the part of patrons by telling Mr. O'Sullivan it was
none of his &mdash;&mdash; business. But I loved to listen to
Mr. O'Sullivan's growlings, and once he realized that,
he used to stop at my counter, take extra long to collect
three slices of lemon, and tell me his latest
grievance. To-night, this Thursday, he was sputtering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure and de y'know what now? I've two
parties out there want finger bowls. <i>Finger bowls!</i>&#8221;
sputtered Mr. O'Sullivan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shure an' it's a long ways from the sight of
finger bowls them two was born. It had better be
a pail apiece they'd be askin' for. Finger bowls indeed!&#8221;
Mr. O'Sullivan had gotten down to a
mumble. &#8220;Shure an' they make me <i>sick</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. O'Sullivan knew that I gave ear to his sentiments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
upon such matters as old parties, male or
female, who must needs order special kinds of extra
digestible bread, and usually that bread must in
addition be toasted. While it was toasting, Mr.
O'Sullivan voiced his views on Old Maids with
Indigestion. Much of it does not bear repeating.
When the toast was done, Mr. O'Sullivan would
hold out his plate with the napkin folded ready for
the toast. &#8220;Shure an yo'r the sweetest child my
eyes ever looked upon&#8221; (Mr. O'Sullivan would say
just the same thing in the same way to a toothless
old hag of ninety). &#8220;Mind you spare yo'rself now
from both bein' an old maid and sufferin' to the
point where y' can't eat plain white bread!&#8221;</p>

<p>This particular Thursday I had even found
some one to talk to in the recreation room when I
sneaked up at three o'clock. There came a time when
Schmitz's patience was strained over my regular
disappearance from about 3 to 3.30. There was
absolutely nothing for me to do just then in my
own line, so I embraced that opportunity daily to
take my way to the recreation room and see
what pickings I could gather up. But one afternoon
Schmitz's face bore an extra-heavy frown. &#8220;Say,
what you do every day that keeps you from your work
all this time? Don't you know that ain't no way to
do? Don't you understand hotel work is just like a
factory? Everybody must be in his place all day and
not go wandering off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever work in a factory?&#8221; I asked Schmitz.</p>

<p>He deigned no answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I'm telling <i>you</i> I have, and hotel
work ain't like a factory at <i>all</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vell, you see it's dis vay&mdash;naturally&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This Thursday up in the recreation room I found
an ancient scrubwoman, patched and darned to
pieces, with stringy thin hair, and the fat, jovial
Irishwoman from the help's pantry. The three of us
had as giddy a half hour as anyone in all New York.
We laughed at one another's jokes till we almost
wept, and forgot all about the thermometer.
The fat Irishwoman had worked at the hotel
two years, the scrubwoman almost that long. Both
&#8220;lived out.&#8221; They, too, informed me I had one of the
best jobs in the hotel&mdash;nobody messin' in with what
you're doin'&mdash;they leave y'alone. The fat one had
worked some time in the linen room, but preferred
pantry work. The linen room was too much responsibility&mdash;had
to count out aprons and towels and
things in piles of ten and tie them, and things like
that&mdash;made a body's head swim.</p>

<p>Realizing Schmitz's growing discomfort, I finally
had to tear myself away. The fat Irishwoman called
after me, &#8220;Good-by, dear, and God bless y'.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upstairs at supper that night I had the luck to
land again at a talkative table. We discussed many
things&mdash;Ireland, for one. One girl was she who had
come two years ago from Ireland and did salads in
the main kitchen. Such a brogue! An Irish parlor
maid had been long years in this country. The two
asked many questions of each other about their
life in the Old Country. &#8220;Shure,&#8221; sighed one, &#8220;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
love every stick and every stone and tree and blade
of grass in Ireland!&#8221; &#8220;Shure,&#8221; sighed the other,
&#8220;an' that's just the way I feel about it, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone at the table liked working at our hotel.
According to them, the hotel was nice, the girls nice,
hours nice.</p>

<p>The subject of matrimony, as ever, came up. Not
a soul at the table but what was ag'in' it. Why
should a woman get married when she can support
herself? All she'd get out of it would be a pack of
kids to clean up after, and work that never ended.
Of course, the concession was eventually made, if
you were sure you were gettin' a good man&mdash;&nbsp;But
how many good men were there in the world? And
look at the divorces nowadays! Why try it at all?
One girl reported as statistically accurate that there
was one divorce in the United States to every four
marriages. &#8220;You don't say!&#8221; was the chorus.</p>

<p>The subject changed to summer hotels. One
woman had worked last summer as a waitress at one
of the beaches. That was the swellest job ever&mdash;just
like a vacation! All summer she had two tables
only to wait on, two persons at a table. Each table
had tipped her five dollars a week. Next summer we
all must try it.</p>

<p>The minutes flew by too fast that supper. Before
I knew it, 5.30 had come around, and by the time
I was downstairs again it was five minutes past
my appointed half hour. Poor, poor Schmitz! And
yet lucky Schmitz. It must have caused his soul
much inner satisfaction to have a real honest-to-goodness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
grievance to complain about. (You see,
he could not go up for his supper until I came down
from mine.) Schmitz upbraided me, patiently, with
explanations. Every single night from then on,
when at five he would tell me I could go upstairs,
he always added, &#8220;And be sure you're back at half
past five!&#8221; In natural depravity of spirit, it was
my delight one night to be able to sneak down at
about 5.25 without being seen by Schmitz. Then
I shrank into a corner of my compartment, out
of his line of vision, and worked busily on my evening
chores. At 5.30, Schmitz began his anxious
scanning of our large clock. By 5.40 he was a
wreck and the clock had nearly been glared off its
hinges. Then it was a waiter called out to me the first
evening order. With the crucified steps of a martyr,
a ten-minute-hungry martyr at that, Schmitz made his
way over to fill that order. And there I was, busily
filling it myself! Of course, I hope I have made it
clear that Schmitz was the kind who would say, &#8220;I
knew she was there all along.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rush of this particular Thursday night! More
lettuce had to be sent for in the middle of the evening,
more tomatoes, more blackberries, more cantaloupes,
more bread for toast. There was no stopping for
breath. In the midst of the final scrubbings and
cleanings came an order of &#8220;One combination salad,
Sweetheart!&#8221; That done and removed and there
sounded down the way, &#8220;One cantaloupe, Honey!&#8221;
Back the waiter came in a moment. &#8220;The old
party says it's too ripe.&#8221; There were only two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
left to choose from. &#8220;Knock his slats in if he
don't like that, the old fossil.&#8221; In another moment
the waiter was back again with the second half.
&#8220;He says he don't want no cantaloupe, anyhow.
Says he meant an order of Philadelphia cream
cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>But nine o'clock came round and somehow the
chores were all done and Schmitz nodded his regal
head ever so little&mdash;his sign for, &#8220;Madam, you may
take your departure,&#8221; and up I flew through the
almost deserted main kitchen, up the three flights to
the service floor, down four flights to the time-clock
floor (elevators weren't always handy), to be greeted
by my friend the time-clock man with his broad
grin and his, &#8220;Well, if here ain't my little bunch
o' love!&#8221;</p>

<p>If he and Schmitz could only have gotten mixed a
bit in the original kneading....</p>

<p>By Saturday of that week I began my diary:
&#8220;Goodness! I couldn't stand this pace long&mdash;waiters
are too affectionate.&#8221; I mention such a matter and
go into some detail over their affection here and there,
because it was in no sense personal. I mean that any
girl working at my job, provided she was not too
ancient and too toothless and too ignorant of the
English language, would have been treated with
equal enthusiasm. True, a good-looking Irishman
did say to me one evening, &#8220;I keep thinkin' to myself
durin' the day, what is there about you that's
different. I shure like it a lot what it is, but I just
can't put my finger on it.&#8221; I used as bad grammar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
as the next; I appeared, I hoped, as ignorant as the
next. Yet another Irishman remarked, &#8220;I don't
know who you are or where you came from or where
you got your education, but you shure have got us
all on the run!&#8221; But any girl with the least wits
about her would have had them on the run. She was
the only girl these men got a chance to talk to the
greater part of the day.</p>

<p>But what if a girl had a couple of years of that sort
of thing? Or does she get this attention only the first
couple of weeks of the couple of years, anyhow? Does a
waiter grow tired of expressing his affection before or
after the girl grows tired of hearing it? I could not help
but feel that most of it was due to the fact that perhaps
among those waiters and such girls as they
knew a purely friendly relationship was practically
unknown. Sex seemed to enter in the first ten
minutes. Girls are not for friends&mdash;they're to flirt
with. It was for the girl to set the limits; the man
had none.</p>

<p>But eight and one-half hours a day of parrying the
advances of affectionate waiters&mdash;a law should be
passed limiting the cause for such exertion to two
hours a day, no overtime. Nor have I taken the
gentle reader into my confidence regarding the
Spanish chef in the main kitchen. He did the roasting.
I had to pass his stove on my way to the elevators.
At which he dropped everything, wiped his hands on
his apron, and beamed from ear to ear until I got by.
One day he dashed along beside me and directed an
outburst of Spanish into my ear. When I shook my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
head and shrugged my shoulders and got it into his
head that I was not a countrywoman, his dismay
was purely temporary. He spoke rather flowery
English. Would I walk up the stairs with him? No,
I preferred the elevator. He, did too. I made the
most of it by asking him questions too fast for him
to ask me any. He was a tailor by trade, but business
had been dull for months. In despair he had
taken to roasting. Some six months he had been at
our hotel. He much preferred tailoring, and in two
months he would be back at his trade in a little shop
of his own, making about fifty to seventy-five dollars
a week. And then he got in his first question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I then ask you to go out with me some
evening?&#8221;&mdash;all this with many beams and wipings
of hands on his apron.</p>

<p>Well, I was very busy.</p>

<p>But one evening. Oh, just one evening&mdash;surely
one evening.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>To-night, then?</p>

<p>No, not to-night.</p>

<p>To-morrow night?</p>

<p>No, no night this week or next week, but perhaps
week after next.</p>

<p>Ah, that is so long, so long!</p>

<p>There was no earthly way to get to the stairs or
elevators except by his stove. I came to dread it.
Always the Spanish ex-tailor dropped everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with a clatter and chased after me. I managed to
pass his confines at greater and greater speed. Invariably
I heard his panting, &#8220;Listen! Listen!&#8221; after
me, but I tore on, hoping to get an elevator that
started up before he could make it.</p>

<p>One day the Spaniard, this tall thin roaster with
the black mustache, was waiting as I came out of
the locker room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen! Listen!&#8221; he panted, from force of habit.
&#8220;Next week is still so very long off.&#8221;</p>

<p>It so happened it was my last day at the hotel. I
told him I was leaving that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, miss!&#8221; He looked really upset. &#8220;Then you
will go out to-night with me. Surely to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, I had a date.</p>

<p>To-morrow night.</p>

<p>No, I had another date.</p>

<p>Sunday&mdash;oh, Sunday, just one Sunday.</p>

<p>Sunday I had two dates.</p>

<p>I should be able to flatter my female soul that at
least he forgot the seasoning that night in his roasts.</p>

<p>Downstairs that first Saturday the little quiet
Spaniard of the pies and ice cream screwed up his
courage, crossed over to my precinct, leaned his
arms on my front counter, and said, &#8220;If I had a wife
like you I would be happy all the rest of my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of those sentiments, he
hastily returned to his pies and ice cream.</p>

<p>The Greek coffee man would take me to a show
that night.</p>

<p>Saturday, to my surprise, was a slack day in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
caf&eacute; business. Trade is always light. Sunday our
kitchen closed shop. Another reason why my job
held allurements. I was the only girl to get Sunday
off. Also, because we were the only department in
the hotel to close down altogether, it seems we were
wont to have an annual picnic. Alas that I had to
miss it!</p>

<p>Plans were just taking shape, too, for this year's
event. Last year they motored over to Long Island.
Much food, many drinks. It was a rosy memory.
This year Kelly wanted a hay ride. Kelly, he of the
highly colored past, even so contended there was
nothing in the world like the smell of hay.</p>

<p>There was no fun to the supper that Saturday night.
I sat at a table with a deaf girl, two dirty men, and
a fat, flabby female with pop eyes, and not a one of
them acted as if he possessed the ability to speak.
Except the deaf girl, who did tell me she couldn't
hear.</p>

<p>So I ate hastily and made for the recreation room.
For the first time the piano was in use. A chambermaid,
surrounded by four admiring fellow-workers,
was playing &#8220;Oh, they're killin' men and women for
a wearin' of the green.&#8221; That is, I made out she
meant it for that tune. With the right hand she
picked out what every now and then approached
that melody. With the left she did a tum-te-dum
which she left entirely to chance, the right hand and
its perplexities needing her entire attention. During
all of this, without intermission, her foot conscientiously
pressed the loud pedal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Altogether there were seven in the chambermaid's
audience. I sat down next to a little wrinkled auburn-haired
Irish chambermaid whose face looked
positively inspired. She beat time with one foot
and both hands. &#8220;Ain't it jus' grand!&#8221; she whispered
to me. &#8220;If I c'u'd jus' play like that!&#8221; Her eyes
sought the ceiling. When the player had finished her
rendition there was much applause. One girl left
the clouds long enough to ask, &#8220;Oh, Jennie, is it
really true you never took a lesson?&#8221; Jennie admitted
it was true. &#8220;Think of that, now!&#8221; the little
woman by me gasped.</p>

<p>The chambermaid next gave an original interpretation
of &#8220;Believe me if all those endearing young
charms.&#8221; At least it was nearer that than anything
else. I had to tear myself away in the middle of
what five out of seven people finally would have
guessed was &#8220;Way down upon the Suwanee River.&#8221;
The faces of the audience were still wreathed in
that expression you may catch on a few faces at
Carnegie Hall.</p>

<p>Monday there was a chambermaids' meeting.
Much excitement. They had been getting seven
dollars a week. The management wished to change
and pay them by the month, instead&mdash;thirty dollars
a month. There was something underhanded about
it, the girls were sure of that. In addition there was
a general feeling that everyone was in for more or
less of a cut in wages about September. A general
undertone of suspicion that day was over everything
and everybody. Several chambermaids were waiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
around the recreation room the few moments before
the meeting. They were upset over that sign under
the picture of Christ, &#8220;No cursing no stealing when
tempted look on his kindly face.&#8221; As long as they'd
been in that hotel they'd never heard no cursin'
among the girls, and as for stealin'&mdash;well, they guessed
the guests stole more than ever the girls did. There
were too many squealers around that hotel, that was
the trouble. One girl spoke up and said it wasn't
the hotel. New York was all squealers&mdash;worst
&#8220;race&#8221; she ever knew for meanness to one another&mdash;nothin'
you'd ever see in the Irish!</p>

<p>I thought back over the dinner conversation that
noon. An Irish girl asked me what my hurry was,
when my work didn't begin till 1.30. I told her
I helped out the Spanish woman and remarked
that I thought it wrong that she didn't get more
pay than I. &#8220;Say,&#8221; said the Irish girl, &#8220;you jus'
look out for your own self in this world and don't
you go round worryin' over no one else. You got
number one to look out for and that's all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement of the day was that the Big Boss
for the first time took note of the fact I was alive.
He said good evening and thought he'd look in my
ice chest. My heart did flutter, but I knew I was
safe. I had scrubbed and polished that ice chest
till it creaked and groaned the Saturday night
before. The brass parts were blinding. But there
was too much food in it for that hour of the night.
He called Schmitz&mdash;Schmitz was abject reverence
and acquiescence. It was, of course, Kelly's fault<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for leaving so much stuff there when he went
at 3. And Kelly was gruff as a bear next day.
Evidently the Big Boss spoke to him about sending
stuff upstairs after the lunch rush was over. He
almost broke the plates hurling things out of the ice
box at 2.30. And the names he called Schmitz
I dare not repeat. He swore and he swore and he
<i>swore</i>! And he stripped the ice box all but bare.</p>

<p>How down on prohibition were Kelly and many of
those waiters! Perhaps all the waiters, but I did not
hear all express opinions. A waiter was talking to
Kelly about it in front of my counter one day. &#8220;How
can we keep this up?&#8221; the waiter moaned. &#8220;There
was a time when if you got desperate you could take
a nip and it carried you over. But I ask you, how
can a man live when he works like this and works
and then goes home and sits around and goes to
bed, and then gets up and goes back and works
and works, and then goes home and sits around?
You put a dollar down on the table and look at
it, and then pick it up and put it in your pocket
again. Hell of a life, I say, and I don't see how
we can keep it up with never a drink to make a
man forget his troubles!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly put forth that favorite claim that there was
far more evil-doing of every sort and description
since prohibition than before&mdash;and then added that
everyone had his home-brew anyhow. He told of
how the chefs and he got to the hotel early one
morning and started to make up six gallons of home-brew
down in our kitchen. Only, o' course, &#8220;some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
dirty guy had to go an' squeal&#8221; on 'em and Kelly
'most lost his job, did Kelly.</p>

<p>I had a very nice Italian friend&mdash;second cook, he
called himself&mdash;who used to come over to the compartment
of Monsieur Le Bon Chef and talk over
the partition to me every afternoon from four to
half past. He also was not in the least fresh, but just
talked and talked about many things. His first
name in Italian was &#8220;Eusebio,&#8221; but he found it more
convenient in our land to go under the name of
&#8220;Vwictor.&#8221; He came from a village of fifty inhabitants
not far from Turin, almost on the Swiss border,
where they had snow nine months in the year.
Why had he journeyed to America? &#8220;Oh, I donno.
Italians in my home town have too little money and
too many children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor was an intelligent talker. I asked him
many questions about the labor problem generally.
When he first came to this country seven years ago
he started work in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria.
In those days pay for the sort of general
unskilled work he did was fifteen to eighteen
dollars a month. Every other day hours were from
6 <small>A.M.</small> to 8.30 <small>P.M.</small>; in between days they got off
from 2 to 5 in the afternoon. Now, in the very same
job, a man works eight hours a day and gets
eighteen dollars a week. Victor at present drew
twenty-two dollars a week, plus every chef's allotment
of two dollars and forty cents a week &#8220;beer
money.&#8221; (It used to be four bottles of beer a day at
ten cents a bottle. Now that beer was a doubtful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
bestowal, the hotels issued weekly &#8220;beer money.&#8221;
You could still buy beer at ten cents a bottle, only
practically everyone preferred the cash.)</p>

<p>But Victor thought he was as well off seven years
ago on eighteen dollars a month as he would be to-day
on eighteen dollars a week. Then, it seems, he
had a nice room with one other man for four dollars
a month, including laundry. Now he rooms alone,
it is true, but he pays five dollars a week for a room
he claims is little, if any, better than the old one, and
a dollar a week extra for laundry. Then he paid two
to three dollars for a pair of shoes, now ten or twelve,
and they wear out as fast as the two-dollar shoes of
seven years before. Now fifty dollars for a suit no
better than the one he used to get for fifteen dollars.
Thus spoke Victor.</p>

<p>Besides, Victor could save nothing now, for he
had a girl, and you know how it is with women. It's
got to be a present all the time. You can't get 'em
by a store window without you go in and buy a waist
or a hat or goodness knows what all a girl doesn't
manage to want. He went into detail over his
recent gifts. Why was he so generous as all that to
his fair one? Because if he didn't get the things
for her he was afraid some other man would.</p>

<p>Nor could Victor understand how people lived in
this country without playing more. Every night,
every single night, he must find some countryman
and play around a little bit before going to bed.
&#8220;These fellas who work and work all day, and
then eat some dinner, and then go home and sit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
around and go to bed.&#8221; No, Victor preferred death
to such stagnation. If it was only a game of cards
and a glass of wine (prohibition did not seem to exist
for Victor and his countrymen) or just walking
around the streets, talking. <i>Anything</i>, so long as it
was <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>Victor was a union man. Oh, sure. He was
glowing with pride and admiration in the union
movement in Italy&mdash;there indeed they accomplished
things! But in this country, no, the union movement
would never amount to much here. For two
reasons. One was that working people on the whole
were treated too well here to make good unionists.
Pay a man good wages and give him the eight-hour
day&mdash;what kind of a union man will he make? The
chances are he won't join at all.</p>

<p>But the main reason why unions would never
amount to much here was centered in the race question.
Victor told of several cooks' strikes he had
been in. What happens? A man stands up and
says something, then everybody else says, &#8220;Don't
listen to him; he's only an Irishman.&#8221; Some one else
says something, and everyone says, &#8220;Don't pay any
attention to him; he's only an Italian.&#8221; The next
man&mdash;he's only a Russian, and so on.</p>

<p>Then pretty soon what happens next? Pretty
soon a Greek decides he'll go back to work, and then
all the Greeks go back; next an Austrian goes back&mdash;all
his countrymen follow. And, anyhow, says my
Italian friend Eusebio, you can't understand nothin'
all them foreigners say, anyhow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked him if Monsieur Le Bon Chef after his
start as a strike breaker had finally joined a union.
&#8220;Oh, I guess he's civilized now,&#8221; grinned Victor.</p>

<p>Numerous times one person or another about our
hotel spoke of the suddenness with which the workers
there would be fired. &#8220;Bing, you go!&#8221; just like
that. Kelly, who had been working there over two
years, told me that the only way to think of a job
was to expect to be fired every day. He claimed he
spent his hour's ride in to work every morning preparing
himself not to see his time card in the rack,
which would mean no more job for him.</p>

<p>I asked Victor one day about the girl who had held
my job a year and a half and why she was fired.
There was a story for you! Kelly a few days before
had told me that he was usually able to &#8220;get&#8221; anybody.
&#8220;Take that girl now what had your job.
I got her. She was snippy to me two or three times
and I won't stand that. It's all right if anybody
wants to get good and mad, but I detest snippy
folks. So I said to myself, 'I'll get you, young lady,'
and within three days I had her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kelly was called away and never finished the story,
but Victor did. The girl, it seems, got several slices
of ham one day from one of the chefs. She wrapped
them carefully in a newspaper and later started up
the stairs with the paper folded under her arm, evidently
bound for the locker room. Kelly was standing
at the foot of the stairs&mdash;&#8220;Somebody had tipped
him off, see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the news to-day?&#8221; asked Kelly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;'Ain't had time to read the paper yet,&#8221; the girl
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we read it now together,&#8221; said Kelly,
whereupon he slipped the paper out from under her
arm and exposed the ham to view.</p>

<p>&#8220;You're fired!&#8221; said Kelly.</p>

<p>He sent her up to the Big Boss, and he did everything
he could think of to get the girl to tell which
chef had given her the ham. The girl refused absolutely
to divulge that.</p>

<p>The Big Boss came down to our kitchen. He
asked each chef in turn if he had given the girl the
ham, and each chef in turn said <i>No</i>.</p>

<p>The Big Boss came back again in a few minutes.
&#8220;We can put the detective force of the hotel on this
job and find out within a few days who <i>did</i> give that
ham away and the man will be fired. But I don't
want to do it that way. If the man who did it will
confess right now that he did I promise absolutely
he will not be fired.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chef spoke up, &#8220;I did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes he was fired.</p>


<p class="thought">As ever, the day for leaving arrived. This time I
gave notice to Kelly three days in advance, so that
a girl could be found to take my place. &#8220;The Big
Chief and I both said when we seen you, she won't
stay long at this job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I indignantly asked Kelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, shucks!&#8221; sighed Kelly. Later: &#8220;Well, you're
a good kid. You were making good at your job, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Only I'll tell y' this. You're too conscientious.
Don't pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>And still later, &#8220;Aw, forget this working business
and get married.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was much red tape to leaving that hotel&mdash;people
to see, cards to sign and get signed. Everyone
was nice. I told Kelly&mdash;and the news spread&mdash;the
truth, that I was unexpectedly going to Europe,
being taken by the same lady who brought me out
from California, her whose kids I looked after. If
after six months I didn't like it in Europe&mdash;and everyone
was rather doubtful that I would, because they
don't treat workin' girls so very well in Europe&mdash;the
lady would pay my way back to America second-class.
(The Lord save my soul.)</p>

<p>I told Schmitz I was going on the afternoon of the
evening I was to leave. Of course he knew it from
Kelly and the others. &#8220;Be sure you don't forget to
leave your paring knife,&#8221; was Schmitz's one comment.</p>

<p>Farewells were said&mdash;I did surely feel like the belle
of the ball that last half hour. On the way out I
decided to let bygones be bygones and sought out
Schmitz to say good-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure you left that paring knife?&#8221; said
Schmitz.</p>



<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></h2>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ere</span> I sit in all the peace and stillness of the
Cape Cod coast, days filled with only such work
as I love, and play aplenty, healthy youngsters
frolicky about me, the warmest of friends close by.
The larder is stocked with good food, good books are
on the shelves, each day starts and ends with a joyous
feeling about the heart.</p>

<p>And I, this sunburnt, carefree person, pretend to
have been as a worker among workers. Again some
one says, &#8220;The artificiality of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in that hot New York the girls I labored
among are still packing chocolates, cutting wick
holes for brass lamp cones, ironing &#8220;family,&#8221; beading
in the crowded dress factory. Up at the Falls they
are hemming sheets and ticketing pillow cases. In
the basement of the hotel some pantry girl, sweltering
between the toaster and the egg boiler, is watching
the clock to see if rush time isn't almost by.</p>

<p>Granted at the start, if you remember, and granted
through each individual job, it was artificial&mdash;my
part in it all. But what in the world was there to do
about that? I was determined that not forever
would I take the say-so of others on every phase of
the labor problem. Some things I would experience
for myself. Certain it is I cannot know any less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
than before I started. Could I help knowing at least
a bit more? I do know more&mdash;I know that I know
more!</p>

<p>And yet again I feel constrained to call attention
to the fact that six jobs, even if the results of each
experience were the very richest possible, are but an
infinitesimal drop in what must be a full bucket of
industrial education before a person should feel
qualified to speak with authority on the subject
of labor. Certain lessons were learned, certain tentative
conclusions arrived at. They are given here for
what they may be worth and in a very humble spirit.
Indeed, I am much more humble in the matter of
my ideas concerning labor than before I took my first
job.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable lesson learned was
that a deep distrust of generalizations has been acquired,
to last, I hope, the rest of life. It is so easy,
so comfortable, to make a statement of fact to cover
thousands of cases. Nowhere does the temptation
seem to be greater than in a discussion of labor.
&#8220;Labor wants this and that!&#8221; &#8220;Labor thinks thus
and so!&#8221; &#8220;Labor does this and the other thing!&#8221;
Thus speaks the labor propagandist, feeling the thrill
of solid millions behind him; thus speaks the &#8220;capitalist,&#8221;
feeling the antagonism of solid millions
against him.</p>

<p>And all this time, how many hearts really beat as
one in the labor world?</p>

<p>Indeed, the situation would clear up with more
rapidity if we went to the other extreme and thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of labor always as thirty million separate individuals.
We would be nearer the truth than to consider
them as this one great like-minded mass, all yearning
for the same spiritual freedom; all eager for the downfall
of capitalism.</p>

<p>What can one individual know of the hopes and
desires of thirty millions? Indeed, it is a rare situation
where one person can speak honestly and intelligently
for one hundred others. Most of us know
precious little about ourselves. We understand still
less concerning anyone else. In a very general way,
everyone in the nation wants the same things. That
is a good point to remember, for those who would
exaggerate group distinctions. In a particular way,
no two people function exactly alike, have the same
ambitions, same capacities.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no great like-minded mass of
laborers. Instead we have millions of workers split
into countless small groups, whose group interests
in the great majority of cases loom larger on the
horizon than any hold the labor movement, as such,
might have on them. Such interests, for instance,
as family, nationality, religion, politics. Besides,
there is the division which sex interests and rivalries
make&mdash;the conflict, too, between youth and age.</p>

<p>Yet for the sake of a working efficiency we must do
a minimum of classifying. Thirty million is too
large a number to handle separately. There seems
to be a justification for a division of labor, industrially
considered, into three groups, realizing the
division is a very loose one:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. Labor or class-conscious group.</li>
<li>2. Industrially conscious group.</li>
<li>3. Industrially nonconscious group.</li>
</ul>


<p>The great problem of the immediate future is to
get groups 1 and 3 into Group 2. The more idealistic
problem of the more distant future is to turn a great
industrially conscious group into a socially conscious
group.</p>


<p class="thought">By the first group, the labor or class-conscious
group, is meant the members of the American Federation
of Labor, Industrial Workers of the World,
four railroad Brotherhoods, Amalgamated Clothing
Workers, socialist and communist organizations&mdash;workers
whose affiliations with certain bodies tend
to make them ultraconscious of the fact that they are
wage workers and against the capitalist system.
Class antagonism is fostered. There is much use of
the word &#8220;exploited.&#8221; In their press and on their
platforms such expressions are emphasized as &#8220;profits
for the lazy who exploit the workers.&#8221; Everything
possible is done to paint labor white, the employer
black, forgetting that no side has the monopoly in
any shade.</p>

<p>To those who from sympathy or antagonism would
picture at least organized labor as like-minded, it
must be pointed out that for the great part the several
millions represented by Group 1 are perhaps
more often warring in their aims and desires than
acting as one. Never have they acted as one. Organized
labor represents but a fraction of labor as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
whole. Some more or less spectacular action on the
part of capital against labor always tends to solidify
the organized workers. They are potentially like-minded
in specific instances. Otherwise the interests
of the carpenters' union tends to overshadow the
interests of the A.&nbsp;F. of L. as a whole; the interests
of the A.&nbsp;F. of L. tend most decidedly to overshadow
the interests of organized labor as a whole. Socialists
bark at communists. Charges of capitalist tendencies
are made against the four Brotherhoods. The
women's unions feel legislated against in the affairs
of labor. Indeed, only utter stupidity on the part of
capital ever could weld organized labor into enough
solidarity to get society or anyone else agitated for
long. Much of the &#8220;open shop&#8221; fight borders on
such stupidity.</p>

<p>Group 2 is at present but an infinitesimal fraction
of labor. It comprises those workers whose background
has been fortunate enough, as to both heredity
and environment, to allow of their main industrial
interests centering around the doing of their
particular job well for the sake of their industry as
a whole, to which a sentiment of loyalty has been
aroused and held. There is no feeling of class antagonism,
no assurance that the interests of labor are
forever inimical to those of the employer, and
<i>vice versa</i>. Where such an attitude exists on the part
of workers it presupposes an employer of unusual
breadth of understanding or a deep love for his
fellow-man. As co-operation in industry can be
shown to pay socially and financially, so may this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
type of employer come more and more to supersede
the old-fashioned &#8220;boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Group 3, the industrially nonconscious workers,
includes the great majority of labor in the United
States. Under this heading come all those who for
reasons connected with the type of industry engaged
in, or because of individual or sex characteristics,
remain apart from any so-called labor movement.
Practically all women fall under this head, most of
the foreign labor population, most of unskilled labor.
Many members of labor organizations technically
belonging in Group 1 really fall under Group 3. The
great majority of American labor undoubtedly are
not class or group conscious in the sense that they
feel themselves as workers pitted against a capitalist
class. Temperamentally, intellectually, the doctrines
of Karl Marx are not for them. They never
heard of Karl Marx. They get up and go to work in
the morning. During the day they dub away at
something or other, whatever it may be&mdash;the chances
are it changes rather often&mdash;putting no more effort
into the day's work than is necessary to hold down
an uninteresting job. They want their pay at the
end of the week. Many have not the minimum intellectual
capacity necessary to do a piece of work
properly. Many more have not the minimum physical
capacity required for even routine tasks. Very
many, indeed, are nervous misfits.</p>

<p>Yet a goodly number in Group 3 represent a high
type of worker to whom the doctrine of class warfare
is repugnant, and yet whose industrial experience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
has never resulted in making them industrially
conscious. They feel no particular call to show more
than average interest in their job.</p>

<p>Peace, efficiency, production in industry, can come
only as Group 2 increases. To recruit from Group
1 will always be difficult. Once labor feels itself hostile
to the employer and his interests, which is another
way of saying, once the employing group by its tactics
succeeds in making labor conclude that &#8220;the
working class and the employing class have nothing
in common,&#8221; the building up of a spirit of co-operation
is difficult indeed. Class consciousness is poor
soil in which to plant any seeds of industrial enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Would you, then, asks a dismayed unionist, build
up your so-called industrially conscious group at the
expense of organized labor? The answer is a purely
pragmatic one, based on the condition of things as
they are, not as idealists would have them. Rightly
or wrongly, the American employing group long ago
decided that the organized-labor movement was
harmful to American industry. The fact that the
labor movement was born of the necessity of the
workers, and in the main always flourished because
of the continued need of the workers, was never
taken into account. Every conceivable argument
was and is used against organized labor. Many of
those arguments are based on half truths; or no
truths at all. The fact remains that probably the
majority of the American public believes the organized-labor
movement to be against our social, civic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and industrial welfare. However right or wrong such
a deduction is, it is safe to say that for the great
part those who hold that belief do so in absolute
good faith.</p>

<p>The result is that the American labor movement
has developed ever in an atmosphere so hostile that
the effect on the growth of the movement has been
that which hostile environment always exerts on
any growing thing. It has warped the movement.
It has emphasized everything hostile within the
movement itself. No wonder a fighting spirit has
ever been in evidence. No wonder only the fighting
type of labor leader has emerged. The movement
has had little or no opportunity for construction.
Always the struggle for existence itself has been
uppermost. No wonder the conclusion can justly be
drawn that the American labor movement has not
always played a highly productive role in American
industry.</p>

<p>It has been everybody's fault, if we are searching
for a resting place for the blame of it all. Which
gets us no place.</p>

<p>The point is, looked at without the tinted glasses of
either capital or labor, that the psychology of the
American employer for the past, assuredly the
present, and at least the near future, has been, and
is, and will be, so inimical to organized labor that the
movement would not be allowed to function as a
constructive industrial force. Too much of its energies
must go to fighting. At the same time, too
much of the energies of the employer go to fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
it. The public pays the price, and it is enormous.
The spiritual cost of bitterness of spirit far outweighs
any monetary loss to industry, tremendous
as that is.</p>

<p>Why is not the present, then, a wise time in which
to encourage an alternative movement, one that has
not the effect of a red rag to a bull? Labor can shout
its loudest; the fact remains that in this country
labor is very far from controlling the industrial situation.
Therefore, the employer must still be taken
into account in any program of industrial reform.
That being so, it might be saner to try some scheme
the employer will at least listen to than stubbornly
continue to fight the issue out along the old lines of
organized labor alone, at the very mention of which
the average employer grows red in the face.</p>

<p>It is not, indeed, that we would do away with the
organized-labor movement, if we could. The condition
is far too precarious for that. Labor too often
needs the support of unionism to keep from being
crushed. The individual too often needs the educational
influence organization exerts. Organized labor,
despite the handicaps within and without, has too
much of construction to its credit. The point is,
further growth in the organized-labor movement,
considering the development forced upon the movement
by its own past and the ever antagonistic attitude
of business, will not, for the present and immediate
future, necessarily spell peace, efficiency, production.
Rather, continued, if not increased, bitterness.</p>

<p>What is the development, at least for the present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and immediate future, which will improve the
situation?</p>

<p>The first move&mdash;and by that we mean the thing
to start doing <i>to-day</i>&mdash;is to begin converting the non-industrially
conscious group into the industrially
conscious group. Group 3 is peaceful&mdash;they call no
attention to themselves by any unrest or demands
or threats. But they are not efficient or productive,
the reason being that they have not enough interest
in their jobs, or in many cases are not physically or
mentally competent. Theirs are sins of omission, not
commission.</p>

<p>The process of this conversion means many things.
It means first and foremost an understanding of human
nature; a realization that the great shortcoming
of industry has been that it held, as organized, too
little opportunity for a normal outlet to the normal
and more or less pressing interests and desires of
human beings.</p>

<p>It worked in a vicious circle. The average job
gave the worker little or no chance to show any
initiative, to feel any sense of ownership or responsibility,
to use such intellect and enthusiasm as he
possessed. The attitude of the average employer
built up no spirit of loyalty or co-operation between
management and men. Hence these very human
tendencies, compelling expression in a normal personality,
became atrophied, as far as the job was concerned,
and sought such functioning as a discouraging
environment left them capable of in fields outside of
industry&mdash;in many cases, within the labor movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
itself. The less capacity the job called out, the more
incapable the worker became. Tendencies inherent
in human nature, whose expressions all these years
could have been enriching the individual and industry,
and therefore the nation as a whole, have been
balked entirely, or shunted off to find expression
often in antisocial outlets. In some cases the loss to
industry was small, since the individual capacities
at best were small. In other cases the loss was
great indeed. In every case, encouragement of the
use of capacities increases the possibilities of those
capacities.</p>

<p>The first step in this process of conversion then is
to reorganize the relationship between management
and men so that as many outlets as possible within
industry can be found for those human expressions
whose functioning will enrich the individual and
industry. Which means that little by little the
workers must share in industrial responsibilities.
The job itself, with every conceivable invention for
calling out the creative impulse, can never, under
the machine process, enlist sufficient enthusiasm for
sustained interest and loyalty on the part of the
worker. He must come to have a word in management,
in determining the conditions under which he
labors five and a half to seven days a week.</p>

<p>It is a nice point here. The parlor Bolshevik pictures
all labor eager and anxious and capable of
actually controlling industry. The fact of the
matter is that most individuals from any and every
walk of life prefer to sidestep responsibility. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
everyone does better under some. Too much may
have a more disastrous effect than not enough&mdash;to
the individual as well as industry. Here again is
where there must be caution in generalizing. Each
employer has a problem of his own. Nor can the
exact amount of responsibility necessary to call out
maximum efficiency and enthusiasm ever be determined
in advance.</p>

<p>I have talked to numerous employers whose experience
has been the same. At first their employees
showed no desire for any added responsibility whatever.
Had there not been the conviction that they
were on the right track, the whole scheme of sharing
management with the workers would have been
abandoned. Little by little, however, latent abilities
were drawn out; as more responsibilities were intrusted
to the workers, their capacities for carrying
the responsibilities increased. In two cases that I
know of personally, the employees actually control
the management of their respective companies. In
both these companies the employers announced that
their businesses were making more money than under
one-sided management.</p>

<p>On the whole, this development of the partnership
idea in industry is a matter of the necessary intellectual
conviction that the idea is sound&mdash;whether
that conviction be arrived at <i>via</i> ethics or &#8220;solid
business judgment&#8221;&mdash;to be followed by the technical
expert who knows how to put the idea into
practice. That he will know only after careful study
of each individual plant as a situation peculiar unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
itself. He is a physician, diagnosing a case of industrial
an&aelig;mia. As in medicine, so industry has its
quacks&mdash;experts who prescribe pink pills for pale
industries, the administration of which may be attended
with a brief show of energy and improvement,
only to relapse into the old pallor. As between a
half-baked &#8220;expert&#8221; and an &#8220;ignorant&#8221; employer
whose heart is in the right place&mdash;take the employer.
If he sincerely feels that long enough has he gone on
the principle, &#8220;I'll run my business as I see fit and
take suggestions from no one&#8221;; if it has suddenly
come over him that, after all, the employee is in most
ways but another like himself, and that all this time
that employee might be laboring under the notion,
often more unconscious than conscious, that he would
&#8220;like to run his job as he saw fit and take suggestions
from no one&#8221;; if, then, that employer calls his men
together and says, &#8220;let's run the business as we all
together see fit and take suggestions from one another&#8221;&mdash;then
is that employer and that business on
the road to industrial peace, efficiency, and production,
expert or no expert. The road is uphill, the
going often rough and discouraging, but more often
than not the load of management becomes lighter,
easing overburdened muscles; the load of labor in a
sense heavier, yet along with the added weight, as
they warm to the task there develops a sense that
they are trusted, are necessary to the success of the
march, that they now are men, doing man-sized
work. Perhaps in only a minimum of cases will the
load ever be divided &#8220;fifty-fifty.&#8221; Too soon would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the workers tire of their added burden, too few could
carry the added weight. The fact remains that with
management carrying the whole load, the march is
going very badly indeed on the whole. At times the
procession scarcely seems to move. There can surely
be no harm in the employing end shifting a bit of the
burden. A bit cannot wreck either side. Managerial
shoulders may feel more comfortable under the decreased
weight and try another shift.</p>

<p>In recruiting Group 2 from Group 3, it is the employer,
on the whole, who must take the initiative.
Labor may show no desire to help shoulder the
burden. Yet they must shoulder some of it to
amount to anything themselves, if for no other reason.
It may take actual pushing and shoving at
first to get them on their way.</p>

<p>Recruiting from Group 1 is a different matter.
There sometimes are workers who would grab most
of the load at the start&mdash;or all of it. Their capacities
are untried, the road and its twistings and turnings
is unknown to them. Each side has been throwing
stones at the other, tripping each other up. There
is a hostile spirit to begin with, a spirit of distrust
between management and men. Here then is a more
difficult problem. It is more than a matter of
shifting the load a bit; it is a matter of changing the
spirit as well. That takes much patience, much
tact. It is not a case of the employer making all the
overtures. Each side is guilty of creating cause for
suspicion and distrust. Each side has to experience
a change of heart. It is one thing to convince a previously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
unthinking person; it is another to bring
about a change of heart in one frankly antagonistic.
Making industrially enthusiastic workers out of
class and labor-conscious workers will indeed be a
task requiring determination, tact, patience without
end, and wisdom of many sorts&mdash;on both sides.
Some one has to sell the idea of co-operation to labor
as well as to the employer. And then know the job
is only begun. But the biggest start is made when
the atmosphere is cleared so that the partnership
idea itself can take root. Some on both sides never
will be converted.</p>

<p>What about the great body of workers unfit physically,
mentally, nervously, to carry any additional
load at all? Here is a field for the expert. Yet here
is a field where society as a whole must play a part.
Most of the physical, mental, nervous harm is done
before ever the individual reaches industry. Indeed,
at most, industry is but one influence out of many
playing on the lives of the human beings who labor.
Nor can it ever be studied as a sphere entirely apart.
Much is aggravated by conditions over which industry
itself has no direct control. Health centers, civic
hygienic measures of all sorts, are of great importance.
A widespread education in the need of healthy
and spiritually constructive influences during the
first ten years of life, if we are to have healthy,
wholesome, and capable adults, must gain headway.
Saner preparation for life as a whole must take the
place of the lingering emphasis on the pedagogical
orthodoxy still holding sway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>While industry is not responsible for many conditions
which make subnormal workers, industry
cannot evade the issue or shift the burden if it
desires peace, efficiency, production. These goals
cannot be obtained on any basis other than the
welfare of the workers. No matter how sane is
welfare work within the plant, there must develop
a growing interest and understanding in &#8220;off the
plant&#8221; work. The job is blamed for much. Yet
often the worker's relation to the job is but the
reflection of the conditions he left to go to work
in the morning, the conditions he returns to after
the day's work is done. There again is a vicious
circle. The more unfortunate the conditions of a
man's home life&mdash;we do not refer to the material
side alone&mdash;the less efficiently he is apt to work
during the day. The less efficiently he works
during the day, the less competent he will be to
better his home conditions.</p>

<p>When men expressed themselves in their particular
handicraft they found much of their joy in life in
their work. One of the by-products of large-scale
industry and the accompanying subdivision of labor
has been the worker's inevitable lack of interest in
the monotonous job. Since too long hours spent at
mechanical, repetitious labor result in a lowered
standard of efficiency, and rebellion on the part of
the worker, there has followed a continual tendency
toward a reduction in the length of the working day.
The fewer hours spent on the job, the greater the
opportunity conditions outside industry proper have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to exert their influence on character formation.
With the shorter working day there develop more
pressing reasons than ever for the emphasis on off-the-plant
activities, and wholesome home and civic
conditions. All these together, and not industry
alone, make the worker.</p>

<p>The growth of the spirit and fruit of industrial
democracy will not bring any millennium. It will
merely make a somewhat better world to live in
here and now. The dreamers of us forget that in the
long run the world can move only so far and so fast
as human nature allows for, and few of us evaluate
human nature correctly. The six industrial experiences
in this book have made me feel that the heart
of the world is even warmer than I had thought&mdash;folk
high and low are indeed readier to love than to
hate, to help than to hinder. But on the whole our
circles of understanding and interest are bounded by
what our own eyes see and our own ears hear. The
problems of industry are enormously aggravated by
the fact that the numbers of individuals concerned
even in particular plants, mills, mines, factories,
stretch the capacities of human management too
often beyond the possibilities of human understanding
and sympathy. More or less artificial machinery
must be set up to bring management and men in
contact with each other to the point where the
problems confronting each side are within eyesight
and earshot of the other. Up to date it has been as
impossible for labor to understand the difficulties of
management as for management to understand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
difficulties of labor. Neither side ever got within
shouting distance of the other&mdash;except, indeed, to
shout abuse! Many a strike would have been
averted had the employer been willing to let his
workers know just what the conditions were which
he had to face; or had the workers in other instances
shown any desire to take those conditions into
account.</p>

<p>For, when all is said and done, the real solution of
our industrial difficulties lies not in expert machinery,
however perfect, for the adjustment or avoidance of
troubles. &#8220;Industrial peace must come not as a
result of the balance of power with a supreme court
of appeal in the background. It must arise as the
inevitable by-product of mutual confidence, real
justice, constructive good will.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> From Constitution of Industrial Council for the Building Industry, England.</p></div>

<p>Any improved industrial condition in the future
must take as its foundation the past one hundred
years of American industry. The fact that this
foundation was not built of mutual confidence, real
justice, constructive good will is what makes the task
of necessary reconstruction so extremely difficult.
Countless persons might be capable of devising the
mechanical approach to peace and prosperity&mdash;courts
of arbitration, boards of representation, and
the like. But how bring about a change of heart in
the breast of millions?</p>

<p>It is a task so colossal that one would indeed prefer
to lean heavily on the shoulders of an all-wise Providence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>and let it go with the consoling assurance that,
as to a solution, &#8220;the Lord will provide.&#8221; But the
echoes of recriminations shouted by each side against
the other; the cries of foul play; the accusations of
willful injustice; the threats of complete annihilation
of capital by organized labor, of organized labor
by capital&mdash;must reach to heaven itself, and Providence
might well pause in dismay. Constructive
good will? Where make a beginning?</p>

<p>The beginnings, however, are being made right on
earth, and here and now. It is a mistake to look for
spectacular changes, reforms on a large scale. Rather
do the tendencies toward mutual understanding and
this all-necessary good will evince themselves only
here and there, in quiet experiments going on in
individual plants and factories. The seed will bear
fruit but slowly. But the seed is planted.</p>

<p>Planted? Nay, the seed has been there forever,
nor have the harshest developments in the most
bloodless of industries ever been able to crush it out.
It is part and parcel of human nature that we can
love more easily and comfortably than hate, that
we can help more readily than hinder. Flourishing
broadcast through all human creation is enough good
will to revolutionize the world in a decade. It is
not the lack of good will. Rather the channels for
its expression are blocked&mdash;blocked by the haste and
worry of modern life, by the multiplicity of material
possessions which so frequently choke our sympathies;
by the cruelties of competition, too often
run to the extremes of crushing out inborn human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
kindness. And most of all, blocked by ignorance and
misunderstanding of our fellow-beings.</p>

<p>It is a sound business deduction that the greatest
stumbling blocks in the difficulties between labor
and capital to-day resolve themselves down to just
that lack of understanding of our fellow-beings.
Yet without that understanding, how build up a
spirit of mutual confidence, real justice, constructive
good will? On what other foundation can a saner
industrialism be built?</p>

<p>The place to make the beginning is in each individual
shop and business and industry. The spark
to start the blaze in each human heart, be it beating
on the side of capital or on that of labor, is the sudden
revelation that every worker is far more the exact
counterpart of his employer in the desires of his
body and soul than otherwise; that the employer is
no other than the worker in body and soul, except
that his scope and range of problems to be met are
on a different level. True it is that we are all far
more &#8220;sisters and brothers under the skin&#8221; than
strangers.</p>

<p>No sane person is looking for a perfect industrialism,
is watching for the day when brotherly love
will be the motive of all human conduct. But it is
within the bounds of sanity to work toward an increase
in understanding between the human factors
in industry; it is justifiable to expect improved industrial
conditions, once increased understanding is
brought about. Industry needs experts in scientific
management, in mental hygiene, in cost accounting&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fields innumerable. But what industry needs
more than anything else&mdash;more, indeed, than all the
reformers&mdash;are translators&mdash;translators of human
beings to one another. &#8220;Reforms&#8221; will follow of
themselves.</p>
